    "resumo": "\"Un soir à Hernani, 26 février 1902\" by Edmond Rostand is a poetic tribute written in the early 20th century. This piece captures the essence of the Spanish village Hernani, intertwining themes of nostalgia, art, and the legacy of Victor Hugo, from whom Rostand draws inspiration. The work reflects on the intersection of personal memory and cultural history, evoking a sense of reverence for artistic creation.  In \"Un soir à Hernani,\" the narrator embarks on a journey to the village of Hernani, inspired by the illustrious namesakes tied to Victor Hugo's works. As he traverses the landscapes and encounters the local inhabitants, he becomes deeply moved by the name Hernani itself, filled with associations of glory and artistic triumph. The narrative juxtaposes the everyday life of the village with the grand ideals of literature, demonstrating how art, particularly Hugo's, immortalizes places in a way that transcends their physical presence. Rostand captures the magic of the moment as he reflects on the relationship between geography, memory, and the impact of literary heritage, blending a celebration of both the village and the indelible mark of the poet's legacy.
