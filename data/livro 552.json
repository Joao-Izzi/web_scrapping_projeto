The story explores themes of childhood, war, and the transition to adolescence, as seen through Ramsey's interactions with his grandfather, peers, and his own developing identity. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a small town in America, steeped in the traditions and lessons of the past, particularly centering around the solemnity of war commemorations and the innocence of youth.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Ramsey Milholland and his grandfather, who are watching a Decoration Day parade together.

The grandfather reflects on his war experience, revealing complexities in the perspectives of both soldiers and their valor.
