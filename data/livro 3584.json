    "resumo": "\"Three Comedies\" by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson is a collection of three plays written in the late 19th century. The works in this volume explore themes of love, family dynamics, and social expectations, featuring complex characters navigating their relationships. Notably, the first play, \"The Newly-Married Couple,\" presents a couple grappling with their responsibilities to family while adjusting to married life, reflecting the societal norms of the time.  At the start of \"The Newly-Married Couple,\" we are introduced to Laura and her husband Axel, who are preparing for a ball. The atmosphere is filled with domestic warmth and familial concern, as Laura's mother suggests she cannot attend due to feeling unwell, but Axel insists on the importance of their attendance. Initial tensions arise as Axel feels frustrated by what he perceives as Laura's obligations to her parents overshadowing their marital bond. The dialogue sets the stage for exploring themes of loyalty, love, and the struggle for independence as the characters navigate their individual desires against the expectations imposed by their family and society.
