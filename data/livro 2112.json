    "resumo": "\"The Song of Hugh Glass\" by John G. Neihardt is a narrative poem written in the early 20th century. It vividly recounts an intense tale from the American Fur Trade era, focusing on the life and struggles of the main character, Hugh Glass, a seasoned hunter and trapper. This epic explores themes of betrayal, survival, and revenge against the backdrop of a harsh wilderness.  The opening of the narrative introduces readers to the setting of 1823, where Major Henry and his men embark on a perilous journey through uncharted territories, accompanied by the aged but formidable Hugh Glass. As the story unfolds, we learn about Glass's character—a grizzled veteran with a complicated past—who forms a bond with the youthful Jamie, a fellow traveler. However, tragedy strikes when Glass is gravely injured by a bear, leading to a betrayal that leaves him abandoned and fighting for survival. The vivid imagery and richly woven poetic language set the stage for an epic struggle against both nature and personal demons as Glass seeks to reclaim his life and confront those who wronged him.
