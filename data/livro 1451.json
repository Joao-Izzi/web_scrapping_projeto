    "resumo": "\"The Tragedies of Seneca\" by Lucius Annaeus Seneca is a collection of dramatic works from ancient Rome, likely written during the first century AD. This work consists of several tragedies that explore themes of fate, morality, and the human condition, showcasing rich rhetorical styles and philosophical undertones. The collection often draws from Greek sources, adapting their narratives while embedding Roman cultural and moral sensibilities.  The opening of the collection introduces the tragedy of Oedipus, setting the scene before the royal palace in Thebes during a time of plague and mourning. The titular character, Oedipus, grapples with profound despair as he confronts the disastrous fate foretold by the oracle: he fears the possibility of committing parricide and incest. As he seeks to uncover the truth behind the afflictions of his kingdom, the narrative delves into his inner conflict regarding identity, familial relationships, and predestination, establishing a sense of dramatic tension that permeates the unfolding tragedy. This beginning engages readers with Oedipusâ€™s tumultuous emotions, laying the groundwork for a deep exploration of tragic themes. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
