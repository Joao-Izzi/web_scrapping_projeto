    "resumo": "\"Les trois mousquetaires, Volume 1 (of 2)\" by Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet is a historical novel written in the early 19th century. The story is set in 1625 France and centers around the young and ambitious d'Artagnan, who dreams of joining the King's Musketeers and embarks on a journey filled with adventure, camaraderie, and danger alongside the famed musketeers Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  The opening of the novel introduces us to d'Artagnan, a young man from Gascony who sets out to Paris with a few possessions, including a letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the captain of the King’s Musketeers. His journey begins with an unfortunate encounter at an inn where his old horse becomes the subject of ridicule, leading to a comical duel with a mysterious gentleman. This courtship of honor and bravado sets the stage for the life d'Artagnan will encounter in Paris, as he seeks to prove himself worthy of the fame of the Three Musketeers and ultimately make his mark in the royal court's intrigues and battles ahead.
