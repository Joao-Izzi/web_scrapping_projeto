    "resumo": "\"The Danish History, Books I-IX\" by Saxo Grammaticus is a historical account written in the early 13th century. This work represents one of the earliest documented histories of Denmark, blending elements of myth, folklore, and recorded history to reflect on the nation’s past. The narrative likely covers the early legends of Danish kings and heroes, showcasing the intertwining of history and mythology.  At the start of the text, the reader is introduced to Saxo Grammaticus, who serves as both historian and storyteller. The opening discusses Saxo's motivations for writing, his position in the literary landscape of medieval Denmark, and his collaboration with Bishop Absalon, who encouraged him to document Denmark's glories. The initial chapters reflect on how Denmark was previously lacking a comprehensive historical record, contrasting with the literary richness of neighboring Iceland. Saxo sets the stage for a narrative that seeks to unite Denmark’s past with its cultural heritage, revealing both the esteemed and embellished tales of kings, the foundational myths of the nation, and Saxo’s own struggle for recognition as a writer in a land with few literary traditions.
