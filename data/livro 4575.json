    "resumo": "\"The Seven Champions of Christendom\" by William Henry Giles Kingston is a whimsical novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story focuses on the adventures of seven legendary champions, each representing a different country: England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, France, Italy, and Spain. The tale follows their fantastical escapades as they battle enchanters, dragons, and other mythical foes, all while accompanied by their faithful, though often comedic, squires.  The opening of the book introduces the birth of Saint George, the most valorous among the champions, who is born under a peculiar omen predicting him to be a dragon-slayer. His father's attempt to seek clarity about the ominous dream his wife had drives him on an ill-fated expedition to consult an enchantress, resulting in him returning with grief at the loss of his wife, while newborn George bears a dragon symbol, foreshadowing epic confrontations. The narrative sets the stage for George's growth into a gallant knight under the guidance of a fairy named Sabrina, preparing for his destiny to face the malevolent Enchantress Kalyb and later embark on heroic adventures alongside the other champions.
