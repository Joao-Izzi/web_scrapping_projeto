    "resumo": "\"Kitty's Enemy: or, the Boy Next Door\" by Eleanora H. Stooke is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Kitty Glanville, a ten-year-old girl, and her experiences with her new neighbor, Tim Shuttleworth, who arrives next door under mysterious circumstances. The narrative explores themes of childhood friendship, misunderstandings, and the consequences of actions taken in anger, as Kitty navigates her feelings towards Tim.  The opening portion introduces Kitty and her brother Bob as they tend to their gardens during their Easter holiday. Their curiosity is piqued by the arrival of Tim, described as an \"ugly-looking boy,\" who seems to be watching them from behind the wall separating their properties. As a series of interactions between the children unfold, tensions rise when Tim, filled with rage after supposedly experiencing the destruction of his garden by Kitty's dog Snip, vows revenge by destroying something belonging to them. The stage is set for a story filled with youthful angst and the potential for resolution as both sides grapple with misunderstandings and emotional responses.
