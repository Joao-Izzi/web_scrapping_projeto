    "resumo": "\"Whom the Gods Destroyed\" by Josephine Dodge Daskam is a fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story delves into themes of artistic genius, personal struggle, and the effects of intoxication and mental distress as it unfolds the encounters of a man inebriated with both drink and life. The central character appears to be Decker, a gifted but troubled pianist grappling with his demons, and a narrator who becomes fascinated by his tumultuous life and musical talent.  The opening of the novel describes a chance encounter between the narrator and a drunken man, who dramatically flails and dances outside a cottage while a woman, Kitty Avery, plays the piano inside. Intrigued by the man, who later identifies himself as a pianist, the narrator learns of his struggles and the complexities surrounding his talent. As the story progresses, the narrator expresses a blend of sympathy for the manâ€™s plight and a desire to witness his musical skill. The tension escalates as the drunken man hints at his past performances and the pain of his current situation. This scene sets the stage for the exploration of deeper themes related to genius, madness, and the fleeting nature of artistic success. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
