    "resumo": "\"On a Chinese Screen\" by W. Somerset Maugham is a travel narrative written in the early 20th century. The work mixes vivid descriptions and observations as the author reflects on his experiences in China, capturing the essence of its landscapes, people, and culture. The narrative appears to explore the contrast between the alluring mystery of the East and the mundane realities of its daily life, offering insights into both the exotic and the ordinary aspects of Chinese society.  The opening of the book introduces readers to a series of lively scenes set in China, immersing them in the richness of the surroundings. Maugham paints a picture of the city gate leading into a bustling marketplace filled with merchants, children, and animals, resulting in a vivid tableau of life. He then shifts focus to a characterâ€”a determined woman transforming an old temple into a home, revealing the interplay between the old and new in the culture. This opening portion sets the tone for a journey that promises to blend personal anecdotes and keen observations, encouraging readers to anticipate a deeply contemplative and engaging exploration of life in a foreign land.
