    "resumo": "\"The Messenger\" by Elizabeth Robins is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story appears to revolve around complex relationships among a group of characters set against a backdrop of social class and personal ambition, particularly highlighting the interactions between the seemingly privileged Gavan Napier and the enigmatic Miss von Schwarzenberg, as well as the lively Madge McIntyre and her American friend, Nan Ellis. Themes of social justice and the intricacies of love and duty emerge through their conversations and encounters.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Gavan Napier and his friend Julian as they play golf near the McIntyre estate. They engage in a discussion about a woman, Miss von Schwarzenberg, who has a unique influence on their lives, particularly on the spirited Madge McIntyre. The dynamics within the household unfold with revelations about the characters' backgrounds and potential connections, particularly with the Pforzheim brothers and their enigmatic father. As the story progresses, the tension builds around the relationships and societal expectations, setting the stage for future conflicts and deeper explorations of fidelity, identity, and social standing.
