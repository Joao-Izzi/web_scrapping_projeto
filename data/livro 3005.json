    "resumo": "\"Kuuriruhtinas ja Raharuhtinas\" by L. Mühlbach is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The book begins with young Prince Wilhelm and his tutor, Baron von Emptich, exploring the city of Frankfurt. The story delves into themes of social class and humanity as the prince is introduced to the suffering of the Jewish people living in the Ghetto, awakening both his compassion and moral reflections on power and privilege.  The opening of the novel sets the stage for a profound exploration of empathy and human dignity. It starts with the prince reluctantly touring various sights of Frankfurt, led by the baron, when they approach the Ghetto. The baron emphasizes the importance of remembering that even the seemingly lowest of society are human beings deserving of compassion, countering young Wilhelm's learned prejudices. This encounter leads to a dramatic moment when a poor Jewish boy, Mayer Anshelm, articulates sharp critiques of societal injustice as he reveals his aspirations for a better life amidst poverty and discrimination, setting up the emotional core of the tale.
