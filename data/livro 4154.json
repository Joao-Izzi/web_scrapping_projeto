    "resumo": "\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a detective novel written in the late 19th century, characterized by the intriguing collaboration between the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusty companion, Dr. John Watson. The story revolves around the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville, which is shrouded in a legend involving a supernatural hound that allegedly haunts the Baskerville family. As the plot unfolds, Watson and Holmes delve into the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles's demise and the potential threats faced by his heir, Sir Henry Baskerville.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Sherlock Holmes as he analyzes a visitor's cane left behind during his consultation. The visitor, Dr. James Mortimer, reveals troubling information about Sir Charles Baskerville's recent death and presents an old family manuscript detailing the curse of the Baskerville hound. This manuscript raises escalated concerns about Sir Henry Baskerville, who is set to inherit the estate and return to Baskerville Hall. The tension builds as it becomes clear that there may be someone, or something, attempting to thwart Henry's arrival, leading to a blend of human and supernatural intrigue that sets the stage for Holmes and Watson's investigation into the dark past of the Baskerville lineage.
