    "resumo": "\"The Hero\" by W. Somerset Maugham is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Colonel Parsons and his wife, who are anxiously preparing for the anticipated return of their son, Jamie, from South Africa. The book delves into themes of honor, disgrace, and the burdens of expectation, particularly concerning the relationship between Colonel Parsons and his son, as they navigate the complexities of familial duty and personal aspirations.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Colonel Parsons and Mrs. Parsons as they await Jamie's arrival, filled with both hope and anxiety. Their backstory reveals that the Colonel has suffered a significant fall from grace due to a disastrous military failure, which has cast a shadow over their family's reputation. This tension is compounded by the expectation that Jamie, upon his return, may restore their family's honor, especially in light of his recent commendation for bravery in battle. The opening sets up a rich exploration of how familial love, societal pressures, and personal guilt intertwine, laying the groundwork for the unfolding drama that will challenge the characters' notions of heroism and worth.
