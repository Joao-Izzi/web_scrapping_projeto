The book aims to provide a comprehensive reference on the Rhodes Scholarships, exploring their origin, purpose, and implications for both prospective scholars and the University of Oxford. The authors compile a variety of facts and insights, aiming to clarify misconceptions and present valuable information to those interested in this prestigious scholarship program.  The opening of the work establishes the authors' intent to illuminate the complexities surrounding the Rhodes Scholarships. They explain that the book is not an official document sanctioned by the Rhodes Trust or Oxford University, but rather a resource compiled from various authoritative sources to answer frequently asked questions about the Scholarships. The authors detail the origins of these Scholarships as established by Cecil Rhodesâ€™s last will, emphasizing his vision for promoting education among young men from British colonies and eventually students from the United States. By outlining key elements such as eligibility and selection criteria, the introduction sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of the Rhodes Scholarship system, its historical context, and its operational framework.
