    "resumo": "\"The Shepheard's Calender: Twelve Aeglogues Proportionable to the Twelve\" by Edmund Spenser is a poetic work written in the late 16th century, specifically during the English Renaissance. This collection features twelve pastoral poems, or \"Ã¦glogues,\" each representing one month of the year, and aims to explore themes of love, nature, and the rustic life. Central characters include shepherds like Colin Clout and rustic figures who express their joys and sorrows through lyrical reflection.  At the start of the text, the narrative introduces Colin Clout, a shepherd, who laments his unfulfilled love for a country lass named Rosalind. His emotional turmoil is depicted through a vivid comparison of his heartache to the harshness of winter, reflecting a deep sense of despair and unrequited affection. Colin's sorrowful state leads him to break his pipe, symbolizing a loss of joy and artistic expression, aligning his personal plight with the melancholic atmosphere of the cold season. This opening sets the tone for a rich exploration of pastoral life entwined with elements of traditional English poetry. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
