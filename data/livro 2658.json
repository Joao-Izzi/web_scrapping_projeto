    "resumo": "\"The Poems and Fragments of Catullus\" by Gaius Valerius Catullus is a collection of classical poetry likely written in the 1st century BC. The work offers a rich tapestry of themes ranging from love and desire to loss and lamentation, showcasing the emotional depth and wit of the poet. Catullus himself emerges as a central figure who navigates the complexities of human relationships, particularly in the context of romantic entanglements.  The opening of this collection introduces readers to Catullus’s poetic style and themes through various poems. The initial segments address a new volume of his work, the beloved sparrow of his mistress, and love’s joy entwined with suffering, setting the tone for a mix of fleeting happiness and deep sorrow. The poet expresses longing and nostalgia as he recounts experiences with his beloved, Lesbia, while simultaneously contemplating mortality and the passing of time. Each poem captures a moment of reflection, inviting the reader into Catullus’s intimate world filled with laughter, anguish, and poignant observations on love and loss.
