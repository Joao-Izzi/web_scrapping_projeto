    "resumo": "\"Stories from Virgil\" by Alfred John Church is a collection of retellings of the ancient Roman epic \"The Aeneid,\" written in the late 19th century. This work aims to present Virgil's narratives in an accessible form for English readers who may not be familiar with the original text's complexity and poetic richness. It focuses on the journey and trials of the Trojan hero Æneas as he seeks to found a new homeland, facing divine obstacles and human conflicts along the way.  At the start of the narrative, the tale unfolds with the introduction of the legendary Trojan War's aftermath, detailing the cunning plan of the Greeks to invade Troy using the infamous wooden horse. Æneas, along with other heroes, is depicted as a key figure amidst the siege and subsequent destruction of his city. The opening chapters lay a foundation for themes of fate, divine intervention, and the struggles between love and duty, particularly as Æneas grapples with his responsibilities after witnessing the fall of Troy and his heart-wrenching farewell to loved ones. Through these initial events, the reader is drawn into a world of myth and valor, setting the stage for Æneas’s epic journey toward establishing a new Troy.
