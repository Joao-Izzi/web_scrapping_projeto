    "resumo": "\"Artificial Light: Its Influence upon Civilization\" by Matthew Luckiesh is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book explores the multifaceted impacts of artificial light on human progress, delving into its historical development alongside civilization, economic implications, and aesthetic influences. Luckiesh aims to present the importance of artificial light as an essential element in the advancement of human activities and social structures.  The opening of the work sets the stage by discussing the transition of humanity from a state of dependence on natural light to one where artificial light has become integral to daily life. Luckiesh reflects on early human existence characterized by the limits of natural illumination and highlights the momentous discovery of fire as a pivotal point in enabling humans to extend their activities beyond daylight hours. He elaborates on the gradual evolution of artificial lighting, from primitive sources to more complex innovations, underscoring how these developments have not only facilitated industrial growth but also contributed to safety, health, and cultural richness in modern society.
