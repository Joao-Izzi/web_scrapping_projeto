    "resumo": "\"The Quiet Life\": Certain Verses by Various Hands by Austin Dobson et al. is a collection of poetry written during the late 19th century. This anthology features verses that explore themes of tranquility, nature, and the contentment found in a simple life, reflecting the artistic sensibilities of the period. With contributions from several poets, including Andrew Marvell and Alexander Pope, the book is thematically unified around the idea of seeking peace and solitude amidst the chaos of urban living.  The collection opens with a prologue by Austin Dobson, which sets the tone for the subsequent verses that emphasize the joys of a quiet life in a garden or tranquil setting. Notable poems include Marvell's \"The Garden,\" which praises the serenity of nature, and Pope's \"Ode to Solitude,\" celebrating contentment in simplicity. Each poem, while reflecting individual styles and perspectives, collectively embodies a yearning for retreat from the busyness of city life and a desire for a harmonious existence. Throughout the anthology, the poets evoke images of pastoral beauty, friendship, and the pleasures of rural living, ultimately proposing a vision of fulfillment that exists away from societal pressures and ambitions.
