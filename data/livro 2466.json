    "resumo": "\"Goethe und Werther: Briefe Goethe's, meistens aus seiner Jugendzeit\" by Goethe is a collection of letters written in the late 19th century. The work features personal correspondence primarily from Goethe's youth, offering insights into his relationships and experiences surrounding the iconic character of Werther, a reflection of Goethe's own romantic entanglements.   At the start of this collection, the reader is introduced to the historical context of Goethe's life during his time in Wetzlar, where he developed a close friendship with Johann Christian Kestner and fell in love with Lotte, events that would inspire his famous work \"Die Leiden des jungen Werther.\" The opening portion highlights Goethe's profound feelings as he navigates his emotions for Lotte amidst the backdrop of his friendship with Kestner. Through these letters, we observe youthful passion and introspection, capturing the essence of Goethe's character and the interconnectedness of friendship and unrequited love that defines much of his early life.
