    "resumo": "\"The Man Farthest Down: A Record of Observation and Study in Europe\" by Booker T. Washington is a travel narrative written in the early 20th century. This work chronicles Washington's observations of the working and poorer classes across various parts of Europe, particularly focusing on their conditions, struggles, and the socio-economic factors influencing emigration to America. The narrative serves as a lens through which Washington draws parallels between the racial and class issues faced by Europeans and those experienced by African Americans in the United States.  The opening of the text sets the stage for Washington's journey, which began on August 20, 1910, when he sails from New York to Liverpool. He describes his desire to utilize his time in Europe to study the lives of the poor, particularly those emigrating to America, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the European race problem compared to that in the South. Washington emphasizes the importance of firsthand encounters with the individuals and communities he seeks to understand, planning to collect their stories while avoiding traditional tourist attractions. The tone is one of inquiry and reflection, aiming to highlight the interconnectedness of socio-economic conditions on both sides of the Atlantic and suggesting that the struggles of the underprivileged in Europe echo those faced by African Americans in the United States.
