    "resumo": "\"All About the Three Little Pigs\" by Anonymous is a children's story that belongs to the fairy tale genre, likely written in the early 20th century. The book presents a classic tale of three little pigs who go out into the world to seek their fortunes, each building their own house with different materials. The narrative focuses on the timeless theme of hard work versus laziness and the consequences that come from the choices made by the characters.  In the story, the first two little pigs construct their homes from straw and wood, which ultimately fail to protect them from the Big Bad Wolf, who easily blows them down and eats the pigs. However, the third pig builds a sturdy house out of bricks, which withstands the wolfâ€™s attempts to destroy it. The clever third pig outsmarts the wolf on several occasions, eventually leading to a confrontation where he tricks the wolf into falling into a pot of boiling water. The tale concludes with the third pig defeating the wolf and living happily ever after, reinforcing the moral that diligence and resourcefulness triumph over folly and deceit.
