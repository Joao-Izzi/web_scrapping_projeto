    "resumo": "\"Christian Mysticism\" by William Ralph Inge is a scholarly exposition written during the late 19th century. This work consists of eight lectures delivered at the University of Oxford, which seek to explore the historical development and fundamental characteristics of Christian mysticism and its philosophical implications within a Christian framework.  The opening of the text establishes the authorâ€™s intention to contribute to the apologetic discourse on Christian mysticism while providing a historical framework to examine its evolution. Inge emphasizes the importance of mystical experiences in the spiritual life and how they serve both as a response to the challenges posed by rationalism and as a means of reform within religious practices. He outlines the complexities surrounding the definitions of mysticism, critiques contemporary interpretations, and highlights the significance of love, purification, and the realization of divine presence as intrinsic to the mystic experience. Through a careful analysis of its historical development, the author aims to present a compelling case for the relevance of mysticism in understanding the Christian faith.
