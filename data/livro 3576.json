    "resumo": "\"Fickle Fortune\" by E. Werner is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative appears to focus on themes of social class and the struggles of youth, particularly through the experiences of two cousins, Count Edmund von Ettersberg and Oswald von Ettersberg, as they navigate their lives against the backdrop of familial expectations and societal pressures. The characters' contrasting personalities hint at deeper themes of ambition, loyalty, and the quest for identity.  The opening of the novel sets the stage during a tumultuous winter journey undertaken by Edmund and Oswald. Their carriage gets stuck in a snowstorm, leading to a chance encounter with a spirited young lady, Fräulein Rüstow, and her companion. As the two gentlemen and the young lady engage in banter, the stark differences in their characters are revealed—Edmund's carefree nature contrasts with Oswald's reserved demeanor. The initial interactions highlight the budding complexities of relationships that will be tested by family dynamics and a looming lawsuit concerning inheritance rights, setting a compelling foundation for the unfolding drama.
