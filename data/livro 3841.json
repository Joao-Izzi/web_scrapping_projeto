    "resumo": "\"King Arthur in History and Legend\" by W. Lewis Jones is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work explores the origins and evolution of the Arthurian legend, delving into the scant historical records and the rich tapestry of mythological and literary traditions that have grown around King Arthur. It seeks to clarify the distinctions between the historical figure of Arthur and the romanticized protagonist found in literature.  The opening of this volume introduces the enduring mystery surrounding King Arthur, noting the lack of solid historical evidence regarding his life and deeds. W. Lewis Jones references early sources such as Nennius's \"Historia Brittonum\", which mentions Arthur as a leading warrior in battles against the Saxons, while highlighting the ambiguous nature of Arthur's statusâ€”whether he was a king or merely a commander. The text further emphasizes the myriad tales and beliefs that have formed around Arthur over the ages, portraying him as a legendary figure whose story has captivated writers, poets, and scholars across centuries.
