    "resumo": "\"Items on the Priesthood, presented to the Latter-day Saints by John Taylor\" is a formal religious text written in the late 19th century. The author, John Taylor, served as the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This book discusses the various aspects and principles of the priesthood within the context of Latter-day Saint beliefs, particularly focusing on the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods, their roles, responsibilities, and hierarchies.  In this work, Taylor systematically presents scriptural references and doctrinal teachings to elucidate the significance of the priesthood in the Church, addressing the uncertain status and authority of bishops and the lesser priesthood. He makes extensive use of extracts from the Bible and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, illustrating how these priesthoods relate to the governance and spiritual leadership of the church community. Taylor emphasizes the eternal nature of the priesthoods, their connection to the governance of the church, and their critical function in ministering to the needs of members, while making a distinction between the roles of Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods throughout biblical history and in the context of modern Latter-day Saints.
