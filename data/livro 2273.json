    "resumo": "\"Strength and How to Obtain It\" by Eugen Sandow is a guide on physical culture and strength training written in the late 19th century. This work focuses on the philosophy and practical strategies for developing strength and overall health through systematic exercise and attention to bodily well-being. Sandow aims to make the principles of physical culture accessible to all, asserting that anyone, regardless of their starting point, can achieve a strong and healthy body by following his methods.  The opening of the book establishes Sandow's belief in the universal desire for strength among people of all ages and conditions. He stresses that strength encompasses not just muscular size but health, vitality, and well-being, and underscores the idea that physical culture is distinct from mere athletics. Sandow discusses the public's evolving perception of physical training and positions his system as a holistic approach to improving oneâ€™s body and life. He provides personal anecdotes and outlines the necessity of willpower in both physical training and the broader quest for personal development, setting the stage for the detailed exercise regimen and principles that follow in the subsequent chapters of the book.
