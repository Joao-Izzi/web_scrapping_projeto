    "resumo": "\"Voces Populi\" by F. Anstey is a collection of humorous sketches originally published in the magazine \"Punch\" during the late 19th century. This work captures the essence of social commentary, light-hearted satire, and witty observations about various aspects of public life, particularly focusing on the experiences and dialogues of ordinary people in different social settings.   The opening of \"Voces Populi\" sets the scene at a suburban hall before a conjurer's performance, where a small, disinterested audience awaits. A humorous interplay emerges between the magician, Herr von Kamberwohl, and his reluctant audience members, revealing their skepticism and casual disdain for the show. As the conjurer attempts to engage the attendees with his magic tricks, particularly involving a hat and absurd props, a comically critical character in evening dress provides sarcastic commentary, drawing further attention to the triviality and humor of the situation. This initial vignette establishes the book's tone, highlighting Anstey's talent for blending humor with social observation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
