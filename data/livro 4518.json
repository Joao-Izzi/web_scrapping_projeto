    "resumo": "\"Tolstoy on Shakespeare: A Critical Essay on Shakespeare\" by Leo Tolstoy is a critical essay written in the early 20th century.\" The essay presents Tolstoy's personal reflections and critiques of Shakespeare's works, particularly focusing on the tragedy \"King Lear.\" Tolstoy challenges the conventional praise for Shakespeare's genius, arguing against the established acclaim and questioning the artistic merits of the plays.  \"The opening of this essay reveals Tolstoy's initial disappointment with Shakespeare's works, contrary to their widely held reputation.\" He describes his attempts over many years to engage with Shakespeare's writings, only to feel confusion and aversion, culminating in a strong conviction that the acclaim for Shakespeare is misguided. The opening segment suggests that Tolstoy plans to dissect the elements of \"King Lear\" to illustrate the perceived flaws and artificiality present in Shakespeare's writing. He sets the stage for a methodical critique that seeks to unearth what he views as Shakespeare's literary shortcomings, preparing readers for an exploration of both the narrative and its characters with the intent to challenge their impact.
