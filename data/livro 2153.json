    "resumo": "\"Homecoming Horde\" by Robert Silverberg is a science fiction novella written in the late 1950s. The story explores themes of isolation, fear, and the fragility of humankind in the face of overwhelming extraterrestrial forces. It focuses on an apocalyptic scenario where the last surviving human, overwhelmed by loneliness and the threat of alien invaders, contemplates his fate as the end of human civilization looms.  In the narrative, Haverford, a reclusive radio operator, discovers that he is possibly the last man on Earth after the arrival of the Lanthaii, a chilling alien species intent on conquering the planet. As he barricades himself in his room, he struggles with the growing silence of his fellow ham operators, who one by one fall victim to the alien onslaught. The novella vividly captures Haverford's escalating paranoia and desperation as he clings to the hope of survival while facing the reality of being utterly alone. In a haunting climax, he confronts the alien invaders, and the story concludes with a poignant contrast between the insignificance of a common Earth fly and the monstrous alien horde, leaving readers with a sense of tragic irony.
