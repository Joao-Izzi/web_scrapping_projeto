    "resumo": "\"Genera and Subgenera of Chipmunks\" by John A. White is a scientific publication written in the early 1950s. The book explores the taxonomy and structural classification of chipmunks, specifically focusing on different genera and subgenera within the Sciuridae family. It addresses longstanding controversies regarding the classification of these small rodents, providing detailed morphological analyses and comparisons.  In this publication, White scrutinizes the similarities and differences among chipmunks, particularly between the subgenera Eutamias and Neotamias, as well as the genus Tamias. Through extensive examination of anatomical structures such as the malleus and baculum, he argues for a reevaluation of the relationships and classifications within these groups. The book presents a thorough analysis based on the examination of numerous specimens and historical taxonomic literature, culminating in a set of conclusions that propose clearer distinctions among the chipmunk subgenera and genera based on structural and taxonomic evidence.
