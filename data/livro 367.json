    "resumo": "\"Woodrow Wilson as I Know Him\" by Joseph P. Tumulty is a historical account written in the early 20th century, focusing on the author's firsthand experiences with President Woodrow Wilson during pivotal moments in American politics. The book aims to provide insight into Wilson's character, decision-making processes, and the political landscape of the time, particularly during his rise to the governorship of New Jersey and his eventual presidency.  The opening of the memoir sets the scene for Tumulty's early political engagement in the Fifth Ward of Jersey City, where he was immersed in vibrant political discussions shaped by the diverse community around his father's grocery store. He reflects on the influential characters and political dynamics that informed his understanding of governance and social issues. Tumulty candidly describes his initial skepticism toward Woodrow Wilson's candidacy for the Senate, illustrating not only his journey in politics but also the evolving perceptions and controversies surrounding Wilson as a leader, especially in the context of the traditional political machine. The narrative hints at the complex interplay between personal relationships and political maneuvering that characterized Wilson's early career, laying the groundwork for a deeper exploration of his presidency.
