    "resumo": "\"The State: Its History and Development Viewed Sociologically\" by Franz Oppenheimer is a sociological treatise written in the early 20th century. The book explores the origins, nature, and evolution of the state through a sociological lens, arguing that states are primarily class organizations that arise through conquest and domination rather than social contracts or natural evolution. Oppenheimer presents a radical view on political structures and the socioeconomic forces that shape them, making it a significant contribution to political economy and sociology.  The opening of the book lays out Oppenheimer's premise that a comprehensive understanding of the state can only be achieved through its historical and sociological examination, rejecting traditional theories that explain the state as a natural or divine institution. He asserts that states inherently radiate from class dynamics, with a focal point on the exploitation involved in their formation. Oppenheimer critiques prevailing ideas from philosophical, economic, and historical perspectives and introduces his sociological concept of \"The State\" as an organization of one class exercising control over others through political means. This foundational concept sets the stage for an extensive exploration of human societal evolution, from primitive forms of organization to modern political states.
