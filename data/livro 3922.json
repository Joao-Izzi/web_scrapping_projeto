    "resumo": "\"Soitto on suruista tehty\" by Antti Mäkinen is a collection of historical poetry written in the early 20th century. The book delves into themes surrounding guilt, redemption, and the human condition through historical figures and events, primarily centered on the trials of Pontius Pilate and Bishop Thomas. It combines elements of drama and reflection, exploring the anguish and moral dilemmas faced by its characters.  The two historical poems in the collection, \"Pilatus\" and \"Piispa Tuomas,\" vividly illustrate the internal struggles and ethical crises experienced by their protagonists. In \"Pilatus,\" the Roman governor grapples with the weight of his decisions leading to the crucifixion of Jesus, facing haunting memories and guilt that ultimately consume him. In \"Piispa Tuomas,\" the bishop reflects on his past mistakes during a failed crusade, lamenting his sense of responsibility for the resulting chaos and suffering. Both characters embody the torment of human frailty, portraying the search for redemption amidst the consequences of their actions, thereby inviting readers to contemplate themes of faith, morality, and the pursuit of absolution.
