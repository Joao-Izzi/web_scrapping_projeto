    "resumo": "\"Obiter Dicta\" by Augustine Birrell is a collection of essays written during the late 19th century. The work explores various literary and philosophical themes, offering critiques and insights on notable figures, particularly focusing on the life and writings of Thomas Carlyle, among others. Through these essays, Birrell provides an intriguing examination of the interplay between literature, criticism, and the human experience.  The opening portion of \"Obiter Dicta\" sets the stage for Birrell's reflections by introducing the concept of an \"obiter dictum,\" a legal term that signifies an incidental remark not binding to law. Birrell uses this as a metaphor to illustrate his own commentary on literature and culture. He begins by addressing Thomas Carlyle, discussing his reputation as a prolific writer and critic. Birrell highlights the complexities of Carlyle's character and literary output, critiquing the notion that Carlyle was merely eccentric. Instead, he frames Carlyle as a significant literary figure whose work merits serious consideration and analysis, thus establishing the tone for the essays that will follow.
