    "resumo": "\"Histoire des ducs de Normandie, suivie de: Vie de Guillaume le Conquérant\" is a historical account, likely written in the early 19th century. This work compiles the narratives of the Dukes of Normandy, particularly focusing on the life and achievements of William the Conqueror. It explores themes of power, conquest, and the formation of modern France through the lens of these prominent figures.  At the start of the text, the author, Guillaume de Jumiège, addresses the reader in a letter dedicated to William the Conqueror, expressing his intention to chronicle the deeds of the Dukes of Normandy. He reflects on the importance of recording both virtuous actions and the legends surrounding the Normans, acknowledging the mix of fact and fable in his account. The opening chapters discuss the historical context of the decline of Frankish power, leading to the invasions by Viking leaders like Hastings, whose brutal conquests laid the groundwork for Norman rule. The writing sets a tone that intertwines religious faith, heroic deeds, and the legendary attributes of characters such as Rollon and Hastings, preparing the reader for detailed tales of valor and conquest that follow.
