    "resumo": "\"Araminta\" by J. C. Snaith is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around an elderly, formidable woman named Caroline Crewkerne, who is preparing to celebrate her seventy-fourth birthday amidst a gathering of eccentric characters and social nuances. The narrative sets the stage for the introduction of her neice, Araminta, whose arrival may bring about unexpected changes in Caroline's meticulously structured life.  The opening portion of the novel introduces readers to the cantankerous yet charming old lady, Caroline, showcasing her sharp wit and disdain for societal pretensions. As she contemplates her own discontent, her thoughts turn to the arrival of her niece, Araminta, who is unknowingly stepping into a humorous and chaotic family dynamic. The character of Miss Perry, Araminta’s first appearance as she arrives in a mismatched outfit, sets a lively tone for the narrative and emphasizes themes of class absurdity and familial tensions. The stage is cleverly set for the ensuing conflicts and comedic situations that arise as Miss Perry’s presence disrupts Caroline’s established order. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
