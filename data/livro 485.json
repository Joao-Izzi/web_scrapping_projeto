    "resumo": "\"The Cyber and Justice Holmes\" by Frank Riley is a science fiction narrative composed in the mid-20th century. The story explores the implications of technology in the judicial system, particularly the concept of \"Cyber justice,\" wherein human judges are replaced by cybernetic units that deliver decisions devoid of human error and emotion. The book delves into the themes of humanity, justice, and the potential consequences of relying too heavily on machines for moral and legal judgments.  The plot centers around Judge Walhfred Anderson, an 86-year-old jurist grappling with the threat of being replaced by a Cyber judge. He presides over a case involving Professor Neustadt, who stands accused of fraud and claims to be able to out-perform a Cyber in answering legal questions. As the trial unfolds, the Professor challenges a Cyber unit to a competition of sorts, using the opportunity to argue for the irreplaceable value of human imagination and emotional understanding in the pursuit of justice. Ultimately, the Professorâ€™s victory over the machine serves as a metaphor for the enduring essence of human creativity and dreaming, asserting that while technology can assist, it should never replace the human spirit in legal and moral matters.
