    "resumo": "\"Herra Byronin ammatti\" by Bernard Shaw is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the character Cashel Byron, a young man struggling with the expectations placed upon him by his mother and his school. The narrative explores themes of identity, ambition, and societal pressures as Cashel grapples with his future while navigating the complexities of adolescence.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Moncrief House, a school for upper-class boys, where the protagonist, Cashel Byron, is presented as a physically strong yet academically underperforming student. As his mother visits the school to discuss his lack of progress, she learns about his tendencies toward violence and distractions, including a penchant for fighting. The vivid descriptions of the classroom dynamics, the disdain from his peers, and the school environment set the stage for the internal and external conflicts Cashel will face. Following a failed escape attempt with a friend, Cashel's determination to break free from confinement reflects his desire for autonomy and self-discovery in a restrictive society.
