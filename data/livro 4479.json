    "resumo": "\"Cyprus, as I Saw It in 1879\" by Sir Samuel White Baker is a historical account written during the late 19th century. The book presents a personal exploration of the island of Cyprus, detailing Baker's observations and reflections on its geography, culture, and political situation following British occupation. The author takes on the role of an independent traveler, aiming to provide an unprejudiced perspective on the island and its ongoing developments.  At the start of the work, Baker recounts his arrival in Cyprus after a smooth voyage from Alexandria. He describes his initial impressions of the island's barren landscapes, contrasting them with the greenery of England. The narrative unfolds with him exploring Larnaca, the town's architecture, its social dynamics, and the local population, while also noting the challenges posed by the environment. Baker establishes his resourcefulness by bringing a traveling van equipped for exploration and describes the peculiarities of the local customs, trade practices, and the overall economic conditions of Cyprus following its recent political changes. This opening segment sets the stage for a detailed account of Baker's travels throughout the island, allowing the reader to grasp the historical context and unique character of Cyprus during that era.
