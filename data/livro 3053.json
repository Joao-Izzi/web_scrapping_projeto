    "resumo": "\"The Surrender of Napoleon\" by Sir Frederick Lewis Maitland is a historical account written in the early 19th century. The work recounts the events surrounding the surrender of Napoleon Bonaparte, detailing his time on board the British ship H.M.S. Bellerophon from May to August 1815. The narrative offers a unique perspective from an eyewitness who played a prominent role in these significant historical moments, seeking to clarify and clarify several misconceptions about Napoleon's experience during his confinement.  At the start of the narrative, the author sets the stage for his subsequent account by outlining the context in which he was commanded to intercept Napoleon’s potential escape following his defeat. Maitland describes the tense atmosphere aboard the Bellerophon as the crew receives sealed orders, learns of Napoleon’s potential movements, and prepares for action—demonstrating both military vigilance and the impending historical significance of their mission. The opening portion effectively establishes a sense of urgency, as well as the personal and professional challenges Maitland faced, foreshadowing the dramatic encounters with Napoleon that will unfold in the ensuing chapters.
