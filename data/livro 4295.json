    "resumo": "\"Household Gods: A Comedy by Aleister Crowley\" is a theatrical work written during the early 20th century. This text blends elements of comedy and tragedy within a fantastical narrative, focusing on themes involving love, desire, and the intertwining of the mortal and divine. The story unfolds within the domestic sphere of a couple, Crassus and his Roman noble wife, Adela, exploring their relationships with each other and a servant named Alicia, against the backdrop of mythological influences.  The play centers around Crassus, a melancholic barbarian, who pines for his wife Adela, who seems lost to the wild delights of nature and a faun. As Crassus grapples with jealousy and despair, Alicia, the servant, emerges as a complex figure who both seduces and challenges him while embodying a bridge between his mundane existence and the divine world represented by Pan. The narrative progresses through a series of lyrical exchanges filled with playful mockery, existential musings, and confrontations with betrayal, ultimately revealing profound secrets about love, identity, and the nature of desire. The twisting paths of love lead the characters to face truths that are both enlightening and tragic, culminating in a surprising revelation about their intertwined fates.
