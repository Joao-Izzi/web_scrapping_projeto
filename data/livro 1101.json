    "resumo": "\"Kid Wolf of Texas\" by Ward M. Stevens is a Western novel written in the early 20th century. The book follows the adventures of the title character, Kid Wolf, a young and charismatic gunslinger from Texas, who embarks on a harrowing journey across dangerous plains. As he confronts various threats, including a notorious bandit known as The Terror, Kid Wolf's bravery and strong sense of justice guide him in protecting the weak and oppressed.  At the start of the story, the reader is introduced to Kid Wolf as he hears a horrific cry echoing across the Llano Estacado. Responding to the sound, he discovers a man who has been tortured by a different foeâ€”The Terror. Kid Wolf, having promised the tortured man that he would rescue a wagon train heading into perilous territory, sets off on a mission to warn and protect them. Unfortunately, upon reaching the wagon train, he finds himself reviled by its leader, Modoc, who is effectively leading the group into danger. This confrontation sets the stage for a gripping series of events filled with tension as Kid Wolf races against time to thwart The Terror's impending attack.
