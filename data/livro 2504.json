    "resumo": "\"Heart: A Social Novel\" by Martin Farquhar Tupper is a social novel written in the mid-19th century. The book delves into the complexities of love, family dynamics, and societal expectations through the lens of a wealthy family facing internal and external pressures. Central characters include Sir Thomas Dillaway, a wealthy and materialistic father, his gentle daughter Maria, and her love interest, Henry Clements, who must navigate the pitfalls of their relationships and societal norms.  The opening of the novel introduces a conversation between Sir Thomas and Lady Dillaway about the potential suitor for their daughter, Mr. Henry Clements. Sir Thomas is determined to know whether Clements is wealthy and openly dismisses any notion of love or affection as unrelated to financial stability. Lady Dillaway, on the other hand, advocates for the virtues of character and kindness, contrasting her husbandâ€™s narrow-mindedness. We also meet Maria, portrayed as empathetic and loving, who secretly adores Henry despite her father's harsh views. This dynamic sets the stage for the unfolding drama as themes of heart versus wealth, familial loyalty, and the notion of social honor intertwine with Maria's plight for love amidst her father's greed and indifference.
