    "resumo": "\"The Dark Road: Further Adventures of Chéri-Bibi\" by Gaston Leroux is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Raoul de Saint-Dalmas, also known as \"the Nut,\" a convict in a penal settlement, who yearns for freedom while facing the torment of his fellow inmates. Alongside him is Chéri-Bibi, a notorious bandit, whose daring plans of escape may offer them both a chance at a new life.  At the start of the narrative, the Nut reflects on his grim existence in the convict settlement, haunted by memories of recent executions and the relentless bullying of his fellow prisoners. He dreams of solitude away from the horrors of prison life, but his hopes rise when he encounters Chéri-Bibi, who has a plan for escape and sees potential in the Nut. The opening portion sets a dark and oppressive tone, capturing the desperation of life behind bars and the bond forming between two very different criminals as they conspire to break their chains and seek freedom on a treacherous journey.
