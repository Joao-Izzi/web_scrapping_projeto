    "resumo": "\"My Sword's My Fortune: A Story of Old France\" by Herbert Hayens is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set in the tumultuous period of 1650 during the Regency of Anne of Austria and the early reign of Louis XIV, the narrative follows a young man named Albert de Lalande as he ventures from his humble beginnings into the chaotic world of Paris. His journey is driven by ambition, a longing to reclaim his family's lost estate, and the desire to find his fortune amidst political intrigue and personal rivalries.  At the start of the story, Albert contemplates his future when Roland Belloc, a soldier with connections to the Cardinal, encourages him to go to Paris in search of fortune. Despite his mother's fears of the dangers that lurk in the city, Albert sets off, motivated by dreams of restoring his family's dwindling fortunes. Upon his arrival in Paris, he quickly realizes the political unrest that envelops the capital, the ongoing plots against powerful figures like Cardinal Mazarin, and the treacherous nature of alliances. The opening chapters introduce a mix of characters, conspiracies, and Albert's internal struggles as he uncovers secrets that will shape his destiny in the heart of 17th-century France.
