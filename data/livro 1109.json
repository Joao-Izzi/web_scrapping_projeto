    "resumo": "\"Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail\" by Ezra Meeker and Howard R. Driggs is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book centers around the author's firsthand experiences as a pioneer traveling the Oregon Trail in the mid-19th century and later retracing that journey in his advanced years. It captures the heroism and struggles of early American settlers who ventured west in search of new opportunities.  The opening of the book introduces Ezra Meeker as a seasoned pioneer who, after years of settling in Washington State, embarks on a journey to reblaze the historic Oregon Trail. He recounts the significance of the trail, both in the past as a route taken by countless pioneers and in the present as he reconnects with the land. Meeker shares vibrant details of his early life, including his family's move from Ohio to Indiana and the grueling two-year trek from Iowa to Oregon with his young wife and child in tow. These initial chapters set the stage for a rich exploration of pioneer life, the landscape traversed, and the memories of those who dared to traverse the path into the new frontier.
