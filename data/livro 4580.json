    "resumo": "\"Marion: The Story of an Artist's Model\" by Onoto Watanna is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story focuses on a young girl named Marion, who is navigating her childhood and aspirations against the backdrop of a large family living in Hochelaga, Montreal. As she grapples with her self-image and dreams of becoming an actress, the narrative explores themes of beauty, ambition, and family dynamics.  At the start of the story, Marion is sent to buy groceries but feels embarrassed when a local grocer discusses her family in a way that makes them seem conspicuous. This sparks Marion's desire to be seen as pretty after a stranger calls her “remarkably pretty.” This moment ignites her aspiration to become an actress, distracting her from her duties at home. The opening portrays her family life, her interactions with her father, a struggling artist, and the challenges of poverty that they face. Marion's vivid imagination and daydreams about fame contrast with the harsh realities of her world, setting the stage for her journey toward self-discovery and ambition.
