    "resumo": "\"West-östlicher Divan: Ten Lyrics with Friulian Translation by Goethe\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a collection of lyrical poems written during the early 19th century. This work is reflective of Goethe's fascination with Eastern culture, particularly Persian literature, and it seeks to bridge the artistic expressions of the East and West. The poems explore themes of love, spirituality, nature, and the human experience, showcasing Goethe's depth as a poet and thinker.  The collection consists of ten lyrical pieces that are interwoven with philosophical musings and emotive imagery. In these lyrics, Goethe employs motifs such as longing, beauty, and the dualities of existence, while also incorporating the voices of figures like Suleika and Hafiz. The translations into Friulian add a layer of accessibility and cultural fusion, preserving the essence of the original German while inviting a broader audience to engage with the themes. The poems collectively express a yearning for connection and understanding across cultural divides, making them timeless reflections on the human condition.
