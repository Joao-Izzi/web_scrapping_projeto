    "resumo": "\"Sämmtliche Werke 4: Mirgorod\" by Nikolai Vasilevich Gogol is a collection of short stories written in the early 19th century. The work explores the lives and experiences of characters from the small Russian provinces, highlighting the unique blend of whimsical fantasy and stark realism that characterizes Gogol's style. Through vibrant portrayals of peasant life, folklore, and strong emotional contrasts, the collection presents a rich tapestry of cultural narratives.  The opening of \"Mirgorod\" introduces Afanassji Iwanowitsch Towstogub and Pulcheria Iwanowna, an elderly couple living in quiet simplicity, deeply bound to one another and their rural life. Gogol vividly describes their humble dwelling, their regular routines, and the charm of their existence while hinting at the broader themes of nostalgia and the passage of time. Through warm humor and tender observations, the narrative captures the essence of their relationship, juxtaposing their serene lives against a looming sense of change and melancholy that subtly foreshadows future events.
