    "resumo": "\"Four and Twenty Fairy Tales\" by J. R. Planché et al. is a collection of fairy tales written in the mid-19th century. This anthology includes stories selected from the works of Charles Perrault and other notable writers of fairy tales from the period. The collection features well-known tales such as “Cinderella,” “Blue Beard,” and “The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood,” inviting readers into a magical world filled with morals, adventure, and enchanting characters.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the context and significance of the fairy tale genre, particularly in relation to French literary history. It emphasizes the enduring theme of transformation and the influence of the original authors on the genre. As we dive into the first selected tale, “Blue Beard,” the narrative begins with a wealthy man with a mysterious past and his striking blue beard, which causes fear and suspicion among local women. This sets in motion a gripping tale of curiosity, disobedience, and ultimately, vengeance, proving to be only a glimpse of the enchanting yet cautionary stories that follow in the collection.
