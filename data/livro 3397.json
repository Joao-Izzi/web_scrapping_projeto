    "resumo": "\"The Boy Nihilist\" by Allan Arnold is a novel set in the backdrop of Russia during a period marked by political oppression. The story follows William Barnwell, a young American man who, after inheriting a fortune, embarks on a journey across the globe. His encounter with an enigmatic stranger leads him to become unwittingly embroiled in the dangerous machinations of Russian politics, specifically the activities of Nihilists aiming to challenge the regime.   At the start of the book, Barnwell is seen boarding the steamship Baltic, excitedly leaving America for Europe. As he meets his friends and enjoys a lively send-off, a mysterious man named Paul Zobriskie approaches him, asking for a favor to deliver an important envelope to Prince Mastowix in St. Petersburg. Despite warnings from his friends about the dangers associated with Zobriskie, Barnwell naively accepts this request. The opening portion sets up a thrilling narrative that intertwines themes of idealism, political struggle, and personal jeopardy, making it clear that the journey will take him far beyond mere sightseeing. As he navigates through high-stakes encounters with secret societies and Russian authorities, readers can anticipate an engaging exploration of the fight for freedom and the costs that come with it.
