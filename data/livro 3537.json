    "resumo": "\"The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith\" by Arthur Wing Pinero is a play written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds in Venice and revolves around the character of Agnes Ebbsmith, a complex woman grappling with her past and her identity, particularly in relation to her partner Lucas Cleeve. The themes of unconventional relationships, societal expectations, and personal freedom seem central to the narrative.  The opening of the play introduces the setting in a Palazzo Arconati, where we meet a cast of characters including Agnes, Lucas, and Gertrude Thorpe. From the beginning, it is established that Agnes has a troubled past—previously married to a man whose memory she struggles with—and grapples with societal perceptions of her current relationship with Lucas, who has recently left his wife. As the characters interact, we learn about their backgrounds, ambitions, and the complexity of their emotions, particularly Agnes's internal conflict about her identity as an independent woman versus the societal role imposed upon her. This setup hints at a deeper exploration of love, social expectations, and the quest for self-understanding throughout the play. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
