    "resumo": "\"The Reina Valera New Testament of the Bible 1862\" by Reina and Valera is a religious text that primarily serves as a translation of the New Testament into Spanish, created during the mid-19th century. This version stems from the historical Valera translation, which is significant in Protestant communities. The text encompasses the teachings, life, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, including the Gospels and Epistles attributed to his apostles.  The opening of this translation introduces the context and history behind the specific version being presented, noting its origins and revisions. The text proceeds directly into the New Testament, beginning with the genealogy of Jesus Christ as detailed in the Gospel of Matthew. It outlines the key events surrounding his birth, including the visit of the Magi and the flight to Egypt, establishing both a historical and spiritual framework for understanding Christ's significance. The first chapters also highlight the early ministry of Jesus and the calling of his disciples, revealing foundational themes of faith, obedience, and spiritual teaching that carry throughout the rest of the text.
