    "resumo": "\"A Certain Rich Man\" by William Allen White is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set against the backdrop of a small town in Kansas during the tumultuous years leading up to and including the Civil War. The narrative focuses on young John Barclay, his childhood adventures, and the unfolding drama as his community grapples with issues of freedom and conflict, particularly through the relationships with key figures like Philemon Ward and the dynamics of the war.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to a group of boys at play in the woods, unaware of the historical significance surrounding their actions. John Barclay is depicted as a free-spirited child who enjoys imaginative games, evoking innocence amidst the larger conflicts brewing around him. The narrative quickly shifts to a pivotal moment in John’s life as he encounters a band of Indians, setting the stage for subsequent reflections on migration, freedom, and the personal cost of war. His experiences are colored by memories of his father’s abolitionist beliefs and the struggles faced by his mother, weaving a rich tapestry of familial bonds, community spirit, and the moral questions surrounding the Civil War.
