    "resumo": "\"A Christian Directory, Part 3: Christian Ecclesiastics\" by Richard Baxter is a theological treatise written in the 17th century. This work serves as a guide for Christians, particularly pastors and their congregations, concerning ecclesiastical duties, worship, and the mutual responsibilities within the church. It seeks to address various church controversies and provides solutions to numerous cases of conscience faced by believers, aiming to cultivate a deeper understanding of proper Christian worship and conduct.  The opening of this section introduces the topic of worship, emphasizing its significance in acknowledging God's existence and attributes. Baxter stresses that worship must be both inwardly sincere and outwardly expressive, delineating between true worship stemming from the heart and mere outward rituals devoid of genuine intent. He also articulates the essential reasons for worshipping God, asserting that it is rooted in the nature of humanity's relationship with the divine. The opening lays the groundwork for further exploration of communal and personal worship practices, highlighting the need for reflection, reverence, and alignment with God's character in all acts of worship.
