    "resumo": "\"Old London Street Cries and the Cries of To-day\" by Andrew White Tuer is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the unique street cries of London vendors, providing a vivid record of daily life in the city, along with a variety of illustrations that capture the essence of the trading culture of the time. It serves as a nostalgic reflection on how these cries, which were once a fixture in the city's auditory landscape, have evolved or faded in modern times.  The opening of the work sets the stage by referencing the historical significance of these street cries, tracing their origins back to the 15th century through the writings of John Lydgate. It includes poetic descriptions of various cries heard in London—such as vendors selling everything from ripe strawberries to hot mutton pies—highlighting their whimsical nature and cultural importance. Various mentions of notable characters and their distinctive calls hint at the multifaceted social fabric of London, revealing how street cries not only advertised goods but also served as a window into the lives of the city's inhabitants.
