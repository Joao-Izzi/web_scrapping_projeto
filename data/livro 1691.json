    "resumo": "\"Le Coq d'Or (The Golden Cock): An Opera in Three Acts by Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov et al.\" is a theatrical opera written in the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around the tale of King Dodon, who relies on a prophetic Golden Cock to safeguard his kingdom. As the story unfolds, themes of power, beauty, and folly play significant roles, showcasing the folly of indulgence and the consequences of misplaced trust.  In the opera, King Dodon, a lazy ruler, becomes increasingly reliant on the Golden Cockâ€™s predictions to govern without effort. The plot thickens when he encounters the beautiful Queen of Shemakhan, who captivates him and ultimately manipulates him. As Dodon's responsibilities mount, his grave misjudgment leads to tragic outcomes, including the loss of his sons in battle. The climax features a dramatic return of the Astrologer, who reveals the moral fable behind the tale, emphasizing the futility of greed for power and the ephemeral nature of life. Ultimately, Dodon's demise serves as a cautionary tale against the hazards of complacency and the unexpected turns of fate. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
