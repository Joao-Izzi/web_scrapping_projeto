    "resumo": "\"The Strolling Saint\" by Raphael Sabatini is a historical novel likely written in the early 20th century. The book centers around the character of Agostino D'Anguissola, the titular \"Strolling Saint,\" whose confessions explore the complexities of his upbringing, shaped by the conflicting influences of his devout mother and his rebellious father's legacy. The story sets a stage for themes of duty, identity, rebellion, and the burdens of familial expectations.  At the start of the novel, Agostino reflects on his origins, notably the significance of names, as he believes that much of his misery can be traced back to the saintly name bestowed upon his mother, Monica. He recounts the painful tensions between his parentsâ€”his mother's pious commitment to vowing him to the Church and his father's rebellious spirit against the Papal authority. The opening chapters introduce us to Agostino's childhood, marked by confinement and conflict, as well as his emotional struggles with identity and freedom, setting the stage for the inner turmoil that will define his journey ahead.
