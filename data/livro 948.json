    "resumo": "\"Adam Johnstone's Son\" by F. Marion Crawford is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Clare Bowring and her mother, Mrs. Bowring, who are navigating their lives following the death of Mrs. Bowring's first husband, Captain Bowring. As they recuperate in Amalfi, their interactions reveal complex dynamics of memory, class, and emerging relationships.  At the start of the novel, Clare and her mother engage in a poignant conversation about the nature of memory and past relationships, leading Clare to reflect on her father's absence. Their peace is disrupted by the arrival of guests from a yacht, particularly by the interaction between Clare and a young man named Brook Johnstone. Through exchanges about life, relationships, and social dynamics, the narrative introduces themes of youth, innocence, and the harsh realities of adult love, revealed dramatically as Clare witnesses Brook's troubled conversation with a married woman, Lady Fan. This glimpse into adult complexities leaves Clare grappling with her understanding of love and trust, setting up the emotional tension that will develop throughout the story.
