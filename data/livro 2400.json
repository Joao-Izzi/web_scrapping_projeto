The story revolves around a group of young Boy Scouts who engage in various rescue missions and encounters with danger while they're on vacation in Florida. The main characters, Alec Sands, Billy Worth, and Chester Brownell, showcase bravery, teamwork, and resourcefulness as they navigate challenges that arise during their vacation.  At the start of the narrative, the boys are on their way to Santario, a town on the Florida coast, where they are visiting Alec's family. During their journey, they encounter a girl in distress on a railway trestle; a freight train approaches, and she is unable to get off the trestle in time. The Scouts spring into action to rescue her, displaying quick thinking and courage as they set off in pursuit, with one Scout risking his safety to ensure her well-being. This opening sets the stage for their adventures and establishes themes of bravery and the importance of the Boy Scout ideals as they engage in life-saving missions throughout their stay.
