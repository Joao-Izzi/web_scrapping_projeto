    "resumo": "\"Your Servant, Sir\" by Sol Boren is a science fiction short story written in the mid-20th century. The narrative revolves around the complexities of human experience through the lens of an android that serves as a household companion. The book likely explores themes of human-machine relationships, idiosyncrasies in artificial intelligence, and the impact of technology on personal relationships.  The story follows Raymond Golden, a frustrated husband whose well-intentioned android servant drives him to the brink. As Raymond grapples with the android's brutally honest comments and behavior that exacerbate his marital strife, he embarks on a comically desperate journey to rid himself of the mechanical aide. After several attempts to get rid of the android, including consulting a psychiatrist for androids, he ultimately faces the realization that his problems may lie deeper within himself than the machine's idiosyncrasies. In a surprising twist, Raymond manages to strike a truce with his android, leading to a humorous acceptance of their unique bond and an exploration of the imperfect companionship that technology offers.
