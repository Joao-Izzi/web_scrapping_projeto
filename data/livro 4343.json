    "resumo": "\"Religion in Japan\" by George A. Cobbold is a historical and sociological account written in the early 20th century. The text examines the interplay and development of various religious traditions in Japan, particularly Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity, against the backdrop of Japan's rapid modernization and cultural transformations. Cobboldâ€™s work aims to elucidate the complex interactions between these faiths and their roles in Japanese society.  At the start of the book, Cobbold sets the stage by discussing Japan's remarkable transformations over a relatively short period, moving from isolation to contact with the Western world, especially through trade and the arrival of Christian missionaries. He introduces the concept of the \"transformation of Japan,\" emphasizing key societal changes, such as shifts in governance and education. Furthermore, he outlines the historical context of Japan's religions, noting the introduction of Buddhism from China, the establishment of Shintoism as a distinct belief system, and the complexities arising from these interwoven religious practices. Cobbold expresses a desire to focus on the religious aspects of Japan, suggesting that the nature of these faiths is crucial for understanding the culture and social dynamics of the nation.
