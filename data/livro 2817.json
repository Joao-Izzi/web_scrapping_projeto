    "resumo": "\"Odysseia\" by Homer is an epic poem written in the 8th century BC. This foundational work of Western literature chronicles the adventures of Odysseus as he attempts to return home to Ithaca after the Trojan War. The narrative centers on themes of heroism, loyalty, and the struggle against divine and mortal challenges, with Odysseus being the primary protagonist whose cleverness and resilience are tested throughout his journey.  The opening of the poem introduces us to Odysseus, who is trapped on the island of Ogygia, held captive by the nymph Calypso who desires him as her lover. Meanwhile, the gods discuss his fate, with Athena advocating for his return while Poseidon remains furious at him for blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. Odysseusâ€™s son, Telemachus, grapples with the suitors plaguing his home and decides to seek news of his missing father. Athena, disguised as the visitor Mentes, encourages Telemachus to take action, setting in motion the events that will lead him to seek his father's whereabouts. This opening sets the stage for a rich tapestry of adventures and encounters that reflect the human experience in the face of adversity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
