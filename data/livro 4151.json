    "resumo": "\"Two Worlds for One\" by George O. Smith is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The book grapples with the concept of global division, both literally and ideologically, as it explores the extreme solutions proposed by an eccentric genius, Professor Paul Monroe Milton, who believes that splitting the Earth in two could solve international conflicts. The story is set against the backdrop of Cold War tensions, reflecting the political climate of the time.  The narrative follows Professor Milton as he resigns from his position to pursue his radical idea of dividing the world into two hemispheres to alleviate strife between competing ideologies, particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union. As he embarks on this ambitious project, a group of officials, including Doctors Edwards and Harris, as well as an agent from the FBI, race against time to prevent a catastrophic separation of the Earth. Despite their efforts, Milton successfully creates a division that results in two moons appearing in the sky, symbolizing the enduring ideological divide. The story concludes with Milton residing in a glass dome on one of the moons, still attempting to reconcile his ambitious theories with the potential consequences of his actions.
