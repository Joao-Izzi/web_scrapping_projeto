The opening of the collection begins with an introduction by Julian Hawthorne, who explores the evolution and structure of riddle stories. He discusses important elements such as the role of the detective and the art of suspense designed to engage the reader. Following this, the first narrative, \"By the Waters of Paradise\" by F. Marion Crawford, introduces a melancholic protagonist who grapples with the specters of his past and a perceived family curse, setting a tone of Gothic romanticism.
