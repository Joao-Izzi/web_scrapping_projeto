It elaborates on the causes leading to the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent downfall of the imperial regime, highlighting the incompetence and miscalculations of French leaders. Through a detailed examination of events such as the ill-fated candidacy of Prince Leopold to the Spanish throne, the opening chapter illustrates the growing tensions that ultimately gave rise to a republic after disastrous military defeats and the upheaval of governance in France.
