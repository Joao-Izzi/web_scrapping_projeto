    "resumo": "\"Baron von Münchhausens merkværdige reiser og eventyr\" by Rudolf Erich Raspe is a collection of fantastical tales written in the late 18th century. The book narrates the extravagant adventures of the titular character, Baron von Münchhausen, who takes readers on a journey filled with humor, absurdity, and outrageous exploits. Raspe's work is a playful exploration of storytelling, where the baron’s fabrications and whimsical encounters challenge the boundaries of reality.  At the start of the collection, we are introduced to Baron von Münchhausen as he recounts his travels to Russia during the winter, humorously detailing his challenges with the cold and navigating treacherous terrain. In a series of amusing events, he helps a shivering man and inadvertently finds himself in a peculiar situation when his horse gets tied to a church steeple. His misadventures follow him to Russia, where he faces a ravenous wolf and has an absurd showdown with a pack of wild ducks. The opening sets the stage for an entertaining blend of daring adventure and comedic narration, establishing the tone for the baron’s remarkable and often ludicrous tales ahead.
