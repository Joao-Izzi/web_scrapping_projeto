    "resumo": "\"The Call of the Wild\" by Jack London is a novel written in the late 19th century, during the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. The story revolves around Buck, a domesticated St. Bernard-Scotch Shepherd mix, who is thrust into the brutal and primal world of the Yukon wilderness, forced to shed his civilized upbringing and adapt to a harsh life of survival.  The opening of the book introduces Buck, who lives a comfortable life as a pet in Judge Miller's home in the Santa Clara Valley. However, his idyllic existence comes to an end when he is kidnapped by Manuel, a gardener's helper with gambling debts. Buck is soon transported to the north, where he faces mistreatment and a stark new reality. The narrative sets the stage for Buck's transformation from a pampered pet to a fierce survivor, illustrating the conflict between civilization and the primal instincts that begin to awaken within him as he navigates life in a wild, unforgiving landscape.
