    "resumo": "\"Bruggil's Bride\" by Robert F. Young is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. Set in a distant future, the story focuses on the journey of Isolde, an android created to perform opera, who undergoes a transformation from a performer to a servant and ultimately to a figure of worship. The book explores themes of identity, worth, and the complexities of existence in a technologically advanced society.  The narrative follows Isolde through various ownerships, beginning with her abduction from a storage facility, where she is repurposed from an operatic android to a servant. Initially purchased by a shrewd trader, her journey takes her to different planets, where she encounters a range of characters, including a mission-driven reverend and a labor recruiter. Eventually, she is mistaken for a goddess by indigenous tribes, leading to her reign as \"Bruggil’s Bride.\" Despite the twists and turns of control and identity, Isolde’s true essence as an artist remains central, culminating in her final act of artistry. As her existence draws to a close, she embodies beauty and tragedy, reflecting on the poignant themes of love and loss, resonating deeply through the operatic echoes of her being.
