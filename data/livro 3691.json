    "resumo": "\"The Devil\" by Ferenc Molnár is a play written in the early 20th century. The story takes place primarily in Vienna and revolves around a group of characters including an artist named Karl Mahler, his model Mimi, and Olga Hofmann, the wife of a banker. As the characters navigate their relationships, the enigmatic figure known as the Devil, who masquerades as Dr. Miller, enters the scene, stirring desires and tensions among them, particularly focusing on themes of love, temptation, and moral dilemmas.  At the start of the play, the scene is set in Karl's studio where tension arises between Karl and his model Mimi, who expresses her sadness over his apparent emotional distance. Karl is preparing for an evening event (a ball) while inside his studio, he is confronted by the arrival of the Devil, whose presence brings an unsettling yet fascinating dynamic. As discussions evolve, Olga and her husband Herman also enter the scene, establishing further complexities in their relationships. The Devil's charm and manipulative nature become evident as he interacts with the characters, suggesting themes of love versus obligation, while foreshadowing events that may lead to romantic entanglements and personal conflicts at the upcoming ball.
