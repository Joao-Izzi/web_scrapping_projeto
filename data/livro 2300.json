    "resumo": "\"The Awakening of the East: Siberia—Japan—China\" by Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book investigates the significant changes in Eastern Asia during a period of economic and political awakening, particularly focusing on regions such as Siberia, Japan, and China. It aims to provide insights into the impacts of Western influences as well as the complexities of international relations in these areas.  The opening of the work begins with a preface highlighting the timely nature of the observations and analysis provided by the author. Leroy-Beaulieu's meticulous research and political insight are commended, as he navigates the intricate dynamics of the Far East, particularly considering the burgeoning influence of Japan, the expansion of Russia through the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the persistent struggles of China with Western powers. The introduction sets the stage for a detailed examination of these regions, characterized by a shift from isolation to engagement with global economic and geopolitical forces, all encapsulated in a framework of personal observation and authoritative statistics.
