    "resumo": "\"Stories of a Western Town\" by Octave Thanet is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The narratives take place in a small Western town and revolve around various characters and their everyday lives, exploring themes such as personal struggles, human relationships, and social dynamics. The first story introduces us to Kurt Lieders, an aging cabinetmaker dealing with existential despair and the impact of his life choices on his wife, Thekla.  The opening of the book presents a poignant scene where Thekla Lieders rushes anxiously to seek help for her husband, who has attempted suicide yet again. As she arrives at the home of Mrs. Olsen, Thekla's emotional turmoil is palpable, revealing the tension in her marriage. Through vivid descriptions and dialogues, we learn about Kurt's struggles with his craft, his relationships with younger workers, and the deep sense of loss he experiences following the death of his mentor. This heartbreaking situation sets the stage for themes of mental health, companionship, and the quest for redemption that continue throughout the collection.
