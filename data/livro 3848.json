    "resumo": "\"The Women of the Arabs\" by Henry Harris Jessup is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book delves into the status of women in Arab society, particularly focusing on their conditions during the Jahiliyeh, or \"Times of Ignorance,\" the early years of Islam, and throughout varying religious contexts such as Druze and Nusairiyeh. The author aims to document the significant missionary efforts made for female education and welfare in the Middle East while exploring cultural attitudes toward women.  The opening of the work begins by setting a context for the treatment of women in pre-Islamic Arabia, detailing the cruel practices such as the burying of female infants and the general disdain for daughters, reflecting a broader cultural pattern of misogyny. It notes instances of both the resilience and contributions of women, particularly through the lens of Arabic poetry, which includes discussions of notable poetesses. The text aims to provide a foundation for understanding the profound shift in women's status initiated by Christian missionary work and the impact of various religious doctrines on Arab womenâ€™s rights and education throughout historical periods.
