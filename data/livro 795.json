    "resumo": "\"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose\" by Kisari Mohan Ganguli is an epic narrative and historical account written during the late 19th century. The text serves as a prose translation of the original Sanskrit Mahabharata, a foundational work of Indian literature that revolves around the themes of duty, righteousness, and the complex moral dilemmas faced by its characters. It encompasses the legendary tale of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and Pandava princes, focusing particularly on heroic characters like Arjuna and Krishna, who are central to the unfolding events.  The opening of the text introduces the majestic setting of the court of King Yudhishthira and the construction of a magnificent assembly hall (Sabha) by the artist Maya for the Pandavas, as instructed by Krishna. Filled with celestial beauty and grandeur, this palace represents not only physical beauty but also the significance of justice and righteousness that underpins Yudhishthiraâ€™s reign. The narrative unfolds with Krishna's interactions, emphasizing themes of gratitude and the responsibilities of kingship as Maya expresses his desire to repay his debt to Arjuna by building a splendid palace. We are also introduced to the familial bonds and deep respect amongst the Pandavas and their allies, setting the stage for the ethical and emotional complexities that will arise throughout the epic.
