    "resumo": "\"What luck! A study in opposites\" by Abbie Farwell Brown is a children's storywritten in the early 20th century. The book explores the contrasting experiences of two young children, Stephanie and Paolo, who are connected through their unfortunate circumstances and the eye troubles that bring them to a charitable infirmary. It highlights the themes of love, neglect, and the varying degrees of care that children receive depending on their situations.  The narrative follows Stephanie, a girl whose mother is neglectful and indifferent, and Paolo, whose overly affectionate mother is unable to let him receive the treatment he desperately needs. As Stephanie undergoes treatment at the Infirmary, she experiences an unexpected awakening, discovering love and care that she had previously lacked at home. Meanwhile, Paolo suffers due to his mother's refusal to prioritize his health. Over time, the stark contrast between the two children's lives illustrates the significant impact of parental attitudes on a child's well-being. Ultimately, the story culminates in hope, as Stephanie returns home to a transformed environment, suggesting that change and improvement are possible even in the direst circumstances.
