    "resumo": "\"The Turning of Griggsby: Being a Story of Keeping up with Dan'l Webster\" by Irving Bacheller is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative captures the life and social dynamics of the fictional village of Griggsby, focusing on the influence of the celebrated orator Daniel Webster on its citizens and their aspirations. The main character, Uriel Havelock, narrates his experiences while attending school and navigating the complexities of youth, love, and ambition in this increasingly competitive society.  At the start of the story, the old schoolmaster Appleton Hall recounts a significant speech by Daniel Webster, setting the tone for the reverence the townspeople hold for him. The protagonist, Uriel Havelock, introduces himself as someone from a humble background who has come to Griggsby to pursue his education. Through his observations, Uriel reveals a village caught in the throes of emulating Webster's grand oratory, often leading to excessive drinking and superficial bravado. He finds himself enamored with Florence Dunbar, a wealthy and beautiful girl, which complicates his feelings of social inferiority. The opening chapters lay the foundation for a comedic exploration of human aspirations, misadventures, and the stark realities of life in a small town during a time of shifting values.
