    "resumo": "\"The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 1 of 9]\" by Shakespeare is a comprehensive collection of the playwright's works that was compiled and edited in the mid-19th century. This volume serves as the first part of a nine-volume set and features several of Shakespeare's plays along with extensive notes that clarify variations and interpretations of the texts. The target readership includes scholars, students, and lovers of literature who seek a deeper understanding of Shakespeare's dramatic and poetic output.  At the start of this volume, the editors, William George Clark and John Glover, lay out their systematic approach to compiling the texts based on a thorough collation of original editions, including various Folios and Quartos. They explain the principles guiding their editorial decisions, such as the inclusion of textual variations in footnotes and a commitment to preserving the language as close to Shakespeare's original style as possible, while still providing clarity for the modern reader. The introductory material sets the stage for the five plays included in this volume, providing context that enriches the reading experience. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
