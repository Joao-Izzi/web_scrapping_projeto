    "resumo": "\"At Large\" by E. W. Hornung is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story introduces the characters Edmonstone and Flint, two partners engaged in licensed hawking across the wilds of Australia. The narrative begins with their journey through the harsh Australian landscape, detailing Edmonstone's ambitions for prosperity and the tensions arising from Flint's more cynical outlook on their endeavors.   The opening portion of the book sets the scene as Edmonstone and Flint travel in their wagon, highlighting their contrasting personalitiesâ€”Flint is laid-back while Edmonstone is eager and anxious about their journey. As they navigate the difficult terrain, Edmonstone expresses his worry about their money and the possibility of encountering danger, especially after learning of recent robberies in the area. Their dialogue reveals Edmonstone's desperation to maintain their financial prospects, culminating in their fateful encounter with a group of masked bushrangers. The tension escalates as they find themselves bound and threatened by the outlaws, marking the beginning of their trials and perhaps foreshadowing the challenges that lie ahead in their quest for fortune.
