    "resumo": "\"Epistola de Manoel Mendes Fogaça\" by José Agostinho de Macedo is a poetic epistle written in the early 19th century. This work blends elements of satire and commentary on contemporary society, particularly focusing on the themes of poetry and identity as it explores the experiences of a poet in Lisbon. It likely addresses the nature of artistic expression and societal observations within the context of its time.  The book presents a whimsical and humorous narrative about the transformation of the speaker into a poet seemingly overnight, inspired by the vibrant and often chaotic life of the streets of Lisbon. Through a series of engaging verses, the speaker observes various dogs, particularly a notable stray called Rafeiro, who becomes a symbol of defiance and freedom. The poet recounts the adventures of Rafeiro as he navigates the urban landscape, battles other dogs, and defies societal expectations. This character serves as a metaphor for the creative spirit and resilience in the face of adversity, ultimately presenting a vivid picture of both the street life and the poet's own journey into the world of poetry.
