    "resumo": "\"Teatro selecto, tomo 3 de 4\" by Pedro Calderón de la Barca is a collection of Spanish comedies written during the 17th century. This volume explores themes of love, honor, and the complexities of human relationships, featuring characters such as Don Félix, Lisardo, and Marcela, who navigate misunderstandings and romantic entanglements typical of Calderón's works.   The opening of this collection presents a lively exchange between Marcela and her maid Silvia, as they express concern over being followed. Lisardo, another character, attempts to pursue Marcela while displaying close readings of the poetic interactions between them. As descriptions and sentiments unfold, underlying tensions surface related to jealousy and perception, particularly as characters express mixed feelings about love and discretion. The stage is set for intricate plots involving hidden identities, love interests, and the consequences of societal expectations, foreshadowing the complications that will arise as the story progresses.
