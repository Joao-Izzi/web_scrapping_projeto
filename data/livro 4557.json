    "resumo": "\"Far to Seek\" by Maud Diver is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the Sinclair family, primarily focusing on young Roy Sinclair, who is the son of Lilámani, an Indian woman of Rajput descent, and Sir Nevil Sinclair, an English baronet. The narrative explores themes of cultural identity, childhood adventure, and the dynamics of a mixed heritage during a time of social and political change, particularly in the context of British colonial India.  The opening portion of the novel introduces Roy as an imaginative and spirited boy in a beautiful summer landscape, filled with a love for nature and stories. He and his companion Tara listen to tales from his mother, Lilámani, which weave their own cultural heritage into their learning experiences. As the idyllic summer day unfolds, they engage in play and dream of adventures, contrasting with the challenges Roy faces from the external world, particularly with the annual societal expectations and familial pressures tied to his mixed heritage. The budding friendship and experiences depicted in the opening set the tone for Roy's journey of self-discovery amidst love, bravery, and cultural complexities.
