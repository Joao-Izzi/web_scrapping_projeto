    "resumo": "\"Cassell's History of England, Vol. 1 (of 8)\" by Anonymous is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This volume provides a comprehensive overview of England's early history, tracing its development from the Roman invasion to the Wars of the Roses. The text delves into significant events, notable figures, and societal changes that shaped the nation during this tumultuous period.  At the start of the work, the author introduces the geographical and cultural context of Britain before Roman influence, focusing on the Celtic tribes and their customs. The narrative describes Julius Caesar's initial invasions and the resistance led by notable figures like Caractacus and Boadicea, highlighting the complexities of both the Roman military campaigns and the indigenous responses to foreign domination. Through an analysis of social structures and religious practices, particularly the role of the Druids, the opening sets the groundwork for understanding the profound transformations that would occur in Britain under Roman rule.
