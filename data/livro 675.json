    "resumo": "\"The Classification of Patents\" by the United States Patent Office is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work outlines the principles and practices involved in the classification of patents within the U.S. Patent Office, providing insights into the methods used to organize an extensive collection of patents in various fields of invention. The book serves as a guide for understanding how patents are categorized to facilitate research and examination.  The opening of the text introduces the need for a systematic approach to patent classification due to the vast diversity of inventions and technologies. It explains that the previous classification methods were inadequate and outlines the background of patent classification in the United States, dating back to the early 19th century. The text discusses the importance of establishing principles to improve classification practices, touching upon the evolution of previous schemes and the necessity for a more logical and efficient system that takes into account function, structure, and utility as bases for categorization. Thus, the opening sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the methods and reasoning behind the classification system that governs patent applications and rights.
