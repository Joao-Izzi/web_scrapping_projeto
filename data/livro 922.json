    "resumo": "\"The Merchant of Venice\" by William Shakespeare is a play written during the late 16th century, which explores themes of love, mercy, and justice. The narrative unfolds primarily around the characters of Antonio, a merchant of Venice, and his close friend Bassanio, who seeks to court the wealthy heiress Portia. The story navigates the complexities of friendship, prejudice, and the quest for love against a backdrop of financial dealings and legal challenges.  The opening of the play sets the stage by introducing Antonio, who is melancholic for reasons unknown to his friends Salarino and Solanio. They speculate about his sadness, suspecting it may relate to love or his maritime ventures. Bassanio soon enters, revealing his desire to woo Portia but confessing his financial troubles, leading to his request for help from Antonio. As the plot develops, we see both the personal stakes involved in relationships as well as the systemic tensions between different social groups, particularly between Christians and Jews, with Shylock, the Jewish moneylender, poised to play a central role in the unfolding drama.
