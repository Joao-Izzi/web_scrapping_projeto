    "resumo": "\"Delay in Transit\" by F. L. Wallace is a science fiction novel written in the early 1950s. The narrative unfolds across the backdrop of an interstellar setting, focusing on the tension and dangers encountered by travelers in the galaxy, particularly on a strange planet called Godolph. The story's central themes involve survival, identity, and the complexities of intergalactic travel, marked by unforeseen troubles that leave characters stranded and fighting for their safety.  The plot centers around Denton Cassal, a sales engineer who finds himself in a precarious situation on Godolph after a delay in his interstellar travel plans. Initially, he is being stalked by a would-be assassin with a mysterious motive tied to his prolonged stay on the planet. As the story unfolds, Cassal discovers that the assassin wants his identification tabâ€”a key piece of documentation that allows for safe passage through space. After a harrowing encounter, he realizes that the identity of the assassin connects to the shadowy workings of the Travelers Aid Bureau, an organization that appears to support stranded travelers but may have ulterior motives. The narrative escalates when Cassal is forced to confront not only those who would harm him but also the machinations behind galactic travel, ultimately leading him to take a significant turn in his quest for survival and identity.
