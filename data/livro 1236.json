    "resumo": "\"The Arabian Nights, Volume II of IV\" by Edward Forster and Antoine Galland is a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales written during the early 18th century. The book includes various stories that are centered around themes of adventure, love, and morality, all framed within the legendary tales told by Scheherazade to delay her execution. One of the main characters introduced in the opening portion is a little hunchbacked man, whose unexpected death sparks a chaotic chain of events, involving a tailor and his wife, a physician, and a series of misunderstandings and accusations.  The opening of this volume presents \"The History of the Little Hunchback,\" where we are introduced to a tailor who befriends a hunchbacked musician. A tragic mishap occurs when the hunchback chokes on a fish bone during dinner at the tailor's home. In a panic to avoid being accused of murder, the tailor and his wife devise a plan to dispose of the body, leading to a comedic sequence of mistaken identities and wrongful accusations among the townspeople. The story unfolds with multiple characters, each adding to the confusion surrounding the hunchback's death and the ethical dilemmas faced by the characters in order to navigate the repercussions of their actions.
