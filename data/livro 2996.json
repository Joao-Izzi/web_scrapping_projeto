    "resumo": "\"The Calling of Dan Matthews\" by Harold Bell Wright is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story begins in the fictional town of Corinth, set in the Ozark Mountains and tells the tale of Dan Matthews, a young minister who is confronted with the complexities of life, societal expectations, and his own convictions. The narrative explores themes of community, morality, and personal calling, all set against the background of a small-town dynamic.  The opening portion of the book introduces Corinth as a town that has seen better days, capturing both its mundane reality and the lingering influence of a locally revered statesman. The character of the Doctor, a seasoned physician who knows the townspeople intimately, sets the stage for Dan Matthewsâ€™ arrival, whom he views as a revelation of what could have been in his own life. Dan's engaging and unassuming nature quickly becomes apparent as he interacts with a variety of characters, including Denny, a crippled boy who tends to his garden and yearns for acceptance. The Doctor also harbors a sense of protective concern for Dan as he realizes that the young minister will face challenges in merging his idealistic values with the expectations of the community. The narrative hints at deeper themes of personal sacrifice and the true nature of calling, inviting readers to ponder the implications of ambition and faith within the context of everyday life.
