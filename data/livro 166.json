    "resumo": "\"Nouveaux contes cruels et propos d'au-delà\" by Villiers de L'Isle-Adam is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The work explores themes of human experience, focusing on societal norms, morality, and the complexities of relationships, often with a darkly ironic or tragic twist. The opening portion introduces various characters and settings that hint at the nuanced psychological and moral dilemmas they'll face.  The beginning of the collection presents a dual exploration of friendship and betrayal through the story of Félicienne and Georgette, who are two young women raised together in a prestigious boarding school. Their inseparable bond is tragically tested when their families face financial ruin, leading them into a world of socialite parties and romantic entanglements. As their friendship begins to fray due to jealousy and betrayal involving a mutual love interest, the narrative delves into deeper reflections on loyalty, loss, and the often harsh realities of adult relationships. The opening sets the stage for a series of intertwined tales that promise both dark comedy and poignant human experiences. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
