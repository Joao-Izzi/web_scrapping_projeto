    "resumo": "\"La vigne et la maison: roman\" by Jean Balde is a novel written in the early 20th century. It centers around Paule Dupouy, a young woman grappling with the recent death of her mother and the ensuing challenges of inheriting her family's estate. As she navigates her grief, family expectations, and societal pressures in a changing world, the narrative explores themes of isolation, resilience, and the complexities of familial relationships.  The opening of the novel introduces Paule Dupouy as she mourns the death of her mother, Madame Dupouy, while faced with the scrutiny and judgment of distant relatives. Contrasting her mother's frailty with her own youthful vitality, Paule experiences feelings of isolation and resentment towards her family, whom she perceives as more concerned with appearances than genuine affection. At her motherâ€™s funeral, family members discuss her future and express their opinions on whether she should marry or sell the property. Paule's desire to remain in the family home, despite the impending loneliness and the expectations of her relatives, sets the tone for her ongoing struggle between personal desire and social obligation.
