    "resumo": "\"Dangerous Dilemmas: Startling but True\" by James Anderson Peddie is a collection of intriguing stories likely written in the late 19th century. The book explores various moral quandaries and unexpected situations, often involving gambling, deception, and life-altering choices faced by the characters. Through a series of anecdotes, Peddie highlights the fine line between fortune and misfortune in human experiences.  The opening of the book introduces readers to a gambling scene at the roulette table in Spa, where the narrator discusses the perils of gambling and the societal changes it has undergone. The conversation between the narrator and the wealthy Dutch banker, Baron Oppenheim, leads to the recounting of two past near-fatal experiences. The first is a close call with death in Java after a chance exchange of overcoats, while the second involves a stormy voyage back to Europe, where the narrator must choose whom to save between the baron and his daughter. These gripping tales set the stage for a deeper exploration of the life-altering consequences of seemingly trivial decisions. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
