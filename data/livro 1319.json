    "resumo": "\"Shakespeare Study Programs: The Comedies\" by Charlotte Porter and Helen A. Clarke is a scholarly compilation of analyses and critiques of several of Shakespeare's comedies, likely written in the late 19th century. This work serves as a comprehensive guide for readers examining the intricacies of characters, themes, and theatrical elements in plays such as \"The Comedie of Errors,\" \"A Midsommer Nights Dreame,\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" among others. It aims to facilitate deeper understanding of Shakespeare's humor and social commentary through structured discussions and queries.  The opening of the book provides an introductory note that sets the stage for the subsequent analyses, highlighting the original publication of the study programs in \"Poet Lore,\" as well as their revisions and expansions. It discusses the historical context of the comedies, Shakespeare's methods of character development, and the narrative devices he employs, such as mistaken identities and the interplay between love and conflict. The beginning emphasizes the importance of these early performances in London and the unique adaptations Shakespeare made from classical sources, setting a foundation for the detailed explorations of individual plays that follow.
