    "resumo": "\"Major Barbara\" by Bernard Shaw is a play written in the early 20th century. The narrative primarily revolves around Lady Britomart Undershaft and her interaction with her son Stephen regarding their estranged father, Andrew Undershaft, a wealthy armaments manufacturer. The play delves into themes of wealth, morality, and the contrasting ideals of social responsibility as embodied by the Salvation Army, of which Barbara, their daughter, is a major.  The opening of the play unfolds in Lady Britomart's library, where she is trying to engage her son Stephen in a serious discussion about their family's financial situation and the impending visit of Andrew Undershaft. Lady Britomart stresses the need to address their father's wealth, as it is intricately tied to their survival and the futures of her daughters, particularly Barbara, who is deeply committed to her work with the Salvation Army. As the conversation progresses, Stephen reveals his unease about his father's questionable morals and the awkwardness of their familial dynamics. We also meet Barbara and her sisters, Sarah and their respective suitors, setting the stage for a broader exploration of class and ethics as the characters grapple with the burdens of their heritage and choices in life.
