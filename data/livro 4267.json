    "resumo": "\"Aunt 'Liza's Hero, and Other Stories\" by Annie F. Johnston is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The book features various characters from a small Indiana village and explores themes of heroism, community, and personal connections through the lens of everyday life. Aunt 'Liza Barnes, a central character, is depicted as a kind and resilient elderly woman who builds deep relationships with the local children, revealing the strength of motherly love and the importance of remembrance.  The opening portion of the collection introduces Aunt 'Liza as she witnesses a ruckus in her neighborhood caused by a runaway team of calves. As the story unfolds, we learn about Aunt 'Liza's background, her strained relationship with her irresponsible son Henry, and her cherished memories of her deceased son, Mac, a soldier who never received the recognition he deserved. Young Jeff, one of the neighborhood boys, becomes intrigued by Aunt 'Liza's past and her longing for recognition, leading to plans for a Decoration Day ceremony where her son's heroism will finally be publicly honored. This sets the stage for a heartwarming exploration of memory, honor, and the bonds that connect generations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
