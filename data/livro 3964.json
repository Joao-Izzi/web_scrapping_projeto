    "resumo": "\"Thirty Degrees Cattywonkus\" by James Bell is a science fiction short story written in the mid-20th century, specifically in the 1960s. The narrative revolves around the peculiar circumstances faced by newlyweds Ernie Lane and Melinee, who recently moved into a mysterious, expansive house. The story delves into themes of alternate dimensions and reality, as the couple encounters an extra door that inexplicably appears and disappears, leading to a bizarre and surreal adventure tied to their identities and perceptions.  The plot follows Ernie as he grapples with his perception of reality when he discovers a mysterious door in his new home, which he initially dismisses as a figment of his imagination. As he confronts the bizarre nature of his surroundings, he becomes entangled in an experiment conducted by beings from another dimension who have mistaken his home for a research site for their interdimensional exploration. The story culminates in Ernieâ€™s struggle against the forces holding him in this alternate reality, leading to a chaotic resolution involving an explosion that ultimately restores the status quo but leaves lingering questions about identity and existence. The tale concludes with a twist that hints at the confusion between dimensions and the nature of Ernie's reality. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
