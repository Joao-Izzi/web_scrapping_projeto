    "resumo": "\"Fleurs De Lys, and Other Poems\" by Arthur Weir is a collection of poetry written during the late 19th century. This volume showcases a range of themes, including Canadian history, nature, love, and reflections on the human experience. The title \"Fleurs De Lys\" refers to the royal emblem associated with France and reflects the historical and cultural significance of the French presence in Canada, which serves as an underlying theme throughout the collection.  The poems are diverse, ranging from narratives honoring pivotal figures in Canadian history, such as Champlain and Maisonneuve, to lyrical explorations of love and nature. Weir utilizes rich imagery and historical references to evoke emotion and a sense of place, connecting the reader to the land and its legacy. The collection includes pieces like \"The Captured Flag,\" which recounts a moment from the siege of Quebec, and \"To One Who Loves Red Roses,\" which delves into the personal nuances of affection.
