    "resumo": "\"Mary, Mary\" by James Stephens is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story captures the life and imaginings of a young girl named Mary Makebelieve and her mother, Mrs. Makebelieve, as they navigate the struggles of poverty in Dublin while holding onto dreams of adventure and wealth. Their relationship is central to the narrative, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the longing for a better life.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Mary as she lives in a small, dingy room in a back street of Dublin with her mother. We learn about their daily struggles, particularly Mrs. Makebelieve's work as a charwoman, and Mary's deep affection for her mother despite the hardships they face. Mary is portrayed as imaginative and longing for a better life, addressing her desires through vivid daydreams about riches and romance, which we see reflected in their whimsical conversations. As she spends her days observing life in the Dublin streets and parks, the young girlâ€™s innocence and hope shine through, setting the stage for further adventures and emotional developments throughout the story.
