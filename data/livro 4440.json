    "resumo": "\"Der Weihnachtsabend\" by Charles Dickens is a classic novella written in the mid-19th century. The story follows Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly old man who despises Christmas and everything associated with it. When visited by the ghost of his deceased partner, Jacob Marley, and three spirits, Scrooge embarks on a transformative journey that explores themes of redemption, generosity, and the spirit of Christmas.  At the start of the tale, we learn about Scrooge's cold-hearted nature and his aversion to Christmas, portrayed through his interactions with his cheerful nephew, his underpaid clerk, and the charitable visitors seeking donations for the needy. The narrative establishes Scrooge's isolation and bitterness, emphasizing his focus on profit over humanity. The ominous arrival of Marley's ghost sets in motion the series of visits from other spirits, who will confront Scrooge with his past and present, leading him towards a pivotal awakening. This opening lays the groundwork for a narrative filled with humor, social commentary, and the potential for change, inviting readers to reflect on their own views of generosity and compassion.
