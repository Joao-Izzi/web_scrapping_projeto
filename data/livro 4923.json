    "resumo": "\"Cidades e Paisagens\" by Jayme de Magalhães Lima is a collection of reflective travelogues written in the late 19th century. The work presents the author's personal observations and thoughts gathered during his journeys across various cities in Europe, with a particular focus on cultural, social, and moral impressions rather than meticulous descriptions of places or events. Through his travels, Lima seeks to explore the relationship between people and their environments, delving into themes of urban identity, nature, and the evolution of societies.  The opening of the text introduces us to the author's introspective style and sets the tone for his travel notes. Lima begins by acknowledging the influences of his father and expresses gratitude for the ability to articulate his reflections. As he embarks on his journey, he discusses the nature of travel, distinguishing between mere curiosity and a more profound understanding of the places he visits. His initial reflections on cities like Salamanca and Paris reveal his preference for exploring not just the physical landscapes, but the deeper cultural and moral nuances inherent in these environments. Through rich descriptions interwoven with personal insights, Lima offers readers a glimpse into his perceptions of European cities as living entities with histories and characters that shape the experience of their inhabitants.
