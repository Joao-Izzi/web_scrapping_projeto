    "resumo": "\"Oeuvres poétiques Tome 2\" by Christine de Pisan is a collection of significant poetic works written during the early 15th century. This volume includes various pieces that delve into themes of love, gender, and morality, showcasing the author's spirited defense of women against the conventions and criticisms of her time.   At the start of the work, the introduction sets the stage for Christine's literary undertaking, emphasizing her aim to elevate her poetic craft from shorter pieces to more profound explorations of poetic themes. The opening piece, \"Épitre au Dieu d'Amours,\" presents a compelling plea from women to Cupid, lamenting the treachery of disloyal men. Christine adopts a satirical tone, using the guise of a formal letter to attack prevailing misogynistic attitudes and to send a clear message about women's worth and honor. She critiques false representations of women while advocating for a nuanced understanding of female fidelity, positioning herself as both an advocate for the fair treatment of women and a notable voice in the literary debate of her era.
