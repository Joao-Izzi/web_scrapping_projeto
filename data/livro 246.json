    "resumo": "\"Gudrun\" by Ferdinand Schmidt is a romantic epic poem translated from German, likely written in the 13th century. It stands as one of the notable medieval epics, alongside the \"Nibelungen Lied,\" intertwining themes of love, valor, and the trials faced by its characters. The story centers on Gudrun, the strong and beautiful daughter of King Hetel, and her suitors, including Hartmut of Normandy and Herwig of Zealand, as they navigate the challenges of love and honor in a tumultuous world.  The opening of the tale introduces readers to Gudrun and her brother Ortwin, as well as their father King Hetel, who has rejected numerous suitors for his daughter's hand. As other princes, including Hartmut and Herwig, vie for Gudrun's affection, tensions rise, leading to conflict and betrayal. A pivotal moment occurs when Gudrun's fate takes a dark turn as she is captured during wartime, setting the stage for her trials and the determination of her loved ones to rescue her. The narrative establishes a rich backdrop of heroism and heartbreak, promising an epic adventure that intertwines themes of loyalty, love, and the strength of the human spirit.
