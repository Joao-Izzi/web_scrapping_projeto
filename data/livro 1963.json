    "resumo": "\"The Wings of the Morning\" by Louis Tracy is a novel written in the early 20th century, likely around the turn of the century. The book revolves around a shipwreck in the tumultuous China Sea, featuring key characters such as Lady Tozer, Captain Ross, and the spirited Iris Deane, who finds herself at the heart of the unfolding drama. The narrative teases a blend of adventure, survival, and personal relationships against the backdrop of a fierce maritime storm.  At the start of the novel, the readers are introduced to the luxurious steamer \"Sirdar\" as it prepares to navigate potentially dangerous waters, with Lady Tozer and Iris Deane aboard. The atmosphere is initially light, filled with witty exchanges between characters, but tension rises when the ship faces a formidable typhoon. During the storm, the \"Sirdar\" suffers catastrophic damage, leading to a harrowing wreck that throws Iris and a sailor named Robert Jenks into a perilous situation on a deserted island. The opening chapters vividly depict the chaos and terrifying uncertainty of the shipwreck, laying the foundation for themes of survival and the budding connection between Iris and Jenks as they confront the challenges of their new, isolated reality.
