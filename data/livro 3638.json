    "resumo": "\"The Deluge in the Light of Modern Science: A Discourse\" by William Denton is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The book critically examines the biblical account of Noah's Ark and the Great Flood through the lens of contemporary scientific understanding. Denton seeks to question the plausibility of the deluge story by exploring its inconsistencies and implausibilities with respect to the known laws of nature.  In this discourse, Denton systematically analyzes the feasibility of the biblical narrative, raising questions about the logistics of gathering all species of animals into the ark, the nutrition and care required for such a vast number of creatures, and the environmental implications of a worldwide flood. He challenges biblical literalism by demonstrating the contradictions between the ancient story and scientific evidence, such as geology, zoology, and ecology, ultimately concluding that the deluge as described in the Bible is not credible. Through a blend of rigorous questioning and empirical reasoning, Denton presents a compelling argument against the traditional interpretation of the flood narrative, inviting readers to reconsider the intersection of faith and science.
