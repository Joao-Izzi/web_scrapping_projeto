    "resumo": "\"Brite and Fair\" by Henry A. Shute is a coming-of-age novel written in the early 20th century. The story is presented through the diary of a young boy, Harry Shute, who shares his daily adventures, thoughts on family life, and humorous observations about the world around him. Through Harry's eyes, readers experience his struggles and joys during a nostalgic summer filled with mischief, friendships, and the ups and downs of growing up.  At the start of the novel, Harry recounts his experiences leading up to and during a church service, where he struggles with the new minister’s sermons about the rights of insects, particularly flies. The humor and childish logic in Harry’s perspective draw the reader into his world, where everyday activities, like washing day or fishing, are filled with excitement and his witty inner monologue. As the chapters progress, we see Harry interact with friends, family, and neighbors, highlighting the dynamics of youth in a small town setting and touching on various themes such as innocence, morality, and the often conflicting rules of childhood.
