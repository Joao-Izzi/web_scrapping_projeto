    "resumo": "\"The Family at Misrule\" by Ethel Turner is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the Woolcot family, particularly focusing on the dynamic between the eldest sister, Meg, and her siblings, including the rebellious Bunty and the sweet Poppet. The coming-of-age story captures family challenges, sibling relationships, and the trials of growing up in a lively household.  At the start of the novel, tensions are palpable in the Woolcot household as Meg tries to juggle her responsibilities while dealing with her siblingsâ€™ antics. The chapter introduces Nell, who is caught in the delicate transition from childhood to adolescence, and Meg, who struggles with the pressures of being the eldest sister while yearning for personal space. The unfolding chaos includes a comedic yet relatable struggle with domestic duties, alongside the deeper issues of Bunty's misbehavior and the affectionate bond shared between him and Poppet.
