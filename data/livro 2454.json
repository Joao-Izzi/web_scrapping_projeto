    "resumo": "\"What Became of Them? and, The Conceited Little Pig\" by G. Boare is a children's book written during the late 19th century. This work consists of two engaging stories that blend elements of fable and moral lessons. The likely topic revolves around themes of consequences, wisdom, and the importance of listening to parental advice.  The first story, \"What Became of Them?\", presents a pair of rats who venture out from their hole, tempted by the scent of cheese, but ultimately disappear, leaving their fate unknown. The second story, \"The Conceited Little Pig,\" follows a young pig who disregards his mother's warnings and repeatedly demonstrates foolish behavior, leading him to suffer consequences, including a tragic end after falling into a well. The underlying message highlights the importance of heeding guidance and the dangers of pride and disobedience in a charmingly illustrated manner. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
