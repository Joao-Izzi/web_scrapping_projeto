    "resumo": "\"In the Fourth Year: Anticipations of a World Peace\" by H. G. Wells is a political treatise written in the late 1910s, amidst the turmoil of World War I. The work elaborates on the concept and necessity for a League of Nations, articulating a hope for global peace and cooperative governance in the wake of devastating conflict. Wells discusses the evolution of ideas surrounding governmental organization, the impacts of imperialism, and the democratic aspirations that must underpin any effective international coalition to prevent future wars.  At the start of the text, Wells reflects on the initial public sentiment regarding the war, identifying it as a \"War of Ideas.\" He acknowledges a budding realization over the horrors of imperialism and the need for significant political reform, including disarmament and establishment of a League of Nations. The opening portion reveals Wells's view that the League must be built on principles of democracy, representing the peoples of the world rather than the interests of their rulers. He emphasizes the importance of a people's league and seeks to clarify that the League must be an inclusive assembly that goes beyond mere diplomacy, indicating changing political sentiments and the urgent desire for collective future planning to create lasting peace.
