    "resumo": "\"The Band Played On\" by LESTER DEL REY is a science fiction novella published in the late 20th century. The story revolves around the life of a space garbage man named Captain Thomas Murdock, exploring themes of heroism, duty, and the often overlooked importance of menial tasks in the grand context of space exploration. Del Rey's narrative provides a unique twist on the traditional space adventure by emphasizing the significance of seemingly mundane jobs in sustaining the larger operations of space travel.  The plot follows Murdock as he grapples with his identity and role as the 'garbage man' for a space station, contrasting his work with the more celebrated tasks of heroic pilots. When an emergency arises in the space station due to toxic air, Murdockâ€™s experience and knowledge become crucial. He volunteers for a dangerous mission to deliver necessary filters, proving that every role, no matter how unglamorous, holds immense value. The narrative culminates in a perilous return leg where Murdock navigates a perilous descent amidst a storm, ultimately leading to his recognition as a hero, albeit reluctantly. The story invites readers to consider the unseen contributions of those who maintain the systems that enable grand adventures, making it both an engaging and thought-provoking read.
