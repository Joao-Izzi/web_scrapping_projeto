    "resumo": "\"The Banner Boy Scouts on a Tour; or, The Mystery of Rattlesnake Mountain\" by George A. Warren is a children's adventure novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story follows a group of Boy Scouts, led by Paul Morrison, as they navigate various challenges and mysteries surrounding their camping trip to Rattlesnake Mountain. Themes of teamwork, bravery, and friendship are central, making it an engaging read for young readers interested in adventure and outdoor activities.  At the start of the story, Paul and his fellow scouts—Jack, Bobolink, and Joe—are returning from a meeting late at night when they stumble upon an ominous situation at Joe's father's feed store. Finding the door ajar and hearing a groan from within, they fear a robbery might be in progress. They discover Joe's father unconscious on the floor, who has fainted while alone, casting suspicion on a potential theft. As they help him regain consciousness, Mr. Clausin realizes that a small tin box he was keeping in his safe is missing. This incident sets the tone for the adventure that follows, which intertwines their camping plans with a search for the missing items, hinting at deeper mysteries awaiting them at Rattlesnake Mountain.
