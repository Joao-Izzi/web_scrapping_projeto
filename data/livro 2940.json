    "resumo": "\"The Three Cities Trilogy: Rome, Volume 2\" by Émile Zola is a historical novel likely written during the late 19th century. This volume continues the intricate storytelling of Pierre Froment, a young priest on a journey of personal and philosophical discovery in post-unification Italy, particularly focusing on the complexities of national identity, politics, and familial ties.  At the start of this volume, we are introduced to Pierre, who contemplates his long-awaited visit to Count Orlando Prada, a legendary figure from Italian history. Following Pierre's emotional connection with the patriot's past and the struggles of independence, Zola weaves a narrative that explores not only the burden of historical legacy on the contemporary world but also the intimate relationships between characters, including Orlando's complex feelings toward his son Luigi and the estrangement from his daughter-in-law, Benedetta. Through conversation and reflection, the opening sets the stage for a deeper examination of what it means to be Italian in a newly unified nation, highlighting themes of sacrifice, disappointment, and the harsh realities of inherited ideals in the changing landscape of modern Rome.
