The story revolves around a con-artist duo, Harding and Sheckly, who engage in schemes to swindle the alien inhabitants of outer planets. The narrative explores themes of deception and cultural misunderstanding in a setting far removed from Earth.  The plot follows Harding and Sheckly as they arrive on a planet inhabited by humanoid lizard creatures. Despite Sheckly's unease about their intentions, Harding is confident they can easily exploit the locals. However, their plans take a dark turn when they discover that the lizard aliens intend to \"help\" them shed their skins literally, as they have misunderstood the nature of the human con. Sheckly's desperate attempts to escape highlight the tension between their criminal intentions and the horrifying realization of their imminent fate.
