    "resumo": "\"The Jester\" by Leslie Moore is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Peregrine, the young son of Nichol the Jester, as he inherits the traditional role of court jester in a world that seems poised between the rigidity of social class and the fluidity of true identity. Through Peregrineâ€™s eyes, the novel explores themes of duty, identity, and the complexity of human relationships, particularly in relation to power dynamics and personal longing.  The opening of \"The Jester\" introduces us to Peregrine, who is grappling with his newly inherited role after the death of his father. As he dons the cap and bells of the jester, he reflects on his father's legacy and the expectations placed upon him. Initial interactions highlight his innocence and the expectations of nobility around him, as well as the societal pressures that accompany his role. In particular, we see Peregrine's forthright nature, which initially endears him to those around him but also leads to his first taste of social injustice. As the narrative unfolds, he begins to navigate the complexities of life at court, his developing skill in jesting, and the deeper emotional currents of his relationships, especially with Isabel, the Lady of the castle, setting the stage for the unfolding drama of love and ambition.
