    "resumo": "\"Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Various Aspects of the Problem of Abortion in New Zealand\" is a government publication authored by a committee led by Dr. D.G. McMillan, produced in the late 1930s. This report investigates the significant issues surrounding abortion in New Zealand, particularly focusing on the incidence of abortion, underlying causes, possible remedial measures, and the legal framework governing abortion practices. The book provides a thorough examination of both septic and criminal abortions, drawing on statistical evidence and accounts from various societal sectors.  The report details alarming statistics indicating that approximately one in five pregnancies ends in abortion, with many being unsafe or illegal. It identifies numerous underlying factors contributing to this issue, including economic hardship, social attitudes towards childbearing, and lack of effective contraception knowledge. The committee recommends preventive measures such as improved economic support for families, the establishment of birth-control clinics, and legislative reforms to address advertising and the illegal abortion market. Ultimately, the report calls for a societal change in attitudes towards family size and better access to healthcare and education to diminish the reliance on abortion as a form of birth control.
