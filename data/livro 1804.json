    "resumo": "\"Tomorrow's Tangle\" by Geraldine Bonner is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set against the backdrop of the harsh and unforgiving landscapes of the American West, the story follows Lucy, a young woman who endures a series of tragedies and trials as she navigates a life marked by hardship and loss. The book delves into themes of survival, resilience, and the complexities of human relationships in a world where both beauty and brutality coexist.  The opening of the novel introduces Lucy and her struggles in the barren Utah desert, where she watches over her dying child while grappling with the weight of her past. This haunting scene sets the stage for a tale of survival as Lucy is alongside her husband, who shows little compassion during their ordeal. They are joined by another woman, who ultimately becomes the catalyst for a significant turning point in Lucy’s life. As the narrative unfolds, the reader is drawn into Lucy’s journey, not only through the desolation of her physical surroundings but also her emotional landscape as she finds herself in a new environment and facing new challenges. This compelling start promises a rich exploration of character, setting, and the determination to seek a better life amidst despair. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
