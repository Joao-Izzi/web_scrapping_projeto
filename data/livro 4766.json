    "resumo": "\"The Red and the Black: A Chronicle of 1830\" by Stendhal is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story centers around a young man named Julien Sorel, who is filled with ambitions that clash with the societal norms of his time. The narrative explores themes of class struggle, personal aspiration, and the complexities of human emotions against the backdrop of a post-Napoleonic France.  The opening of the novel establishes the quaint town of Verrières, where local life is shaped by trade, particularly the manufacture of painted tiles and nails. Here, we meet M. de Rênal, the mayor, whose wealth and status come from his successful business endeavors. As he and his wife, Madame de Rênal, prepare for the arrival of their new tutor, Julien Sorel, the tensions of ambition and social class begin to emerge. Julien is introduced as a complex character, coming from humble beginnings and demonstrating both sensitivity and fierce ambition, as he navigates his precarious position in the household and contemplates his aspirations for social mobility. This opening lays the groundwork for the intricate social dynamics that will unfold as Julien attempts to assert his identity against the constraints of his origins.
