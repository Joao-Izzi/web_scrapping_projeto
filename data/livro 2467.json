    "resumo": "\"The Negro Problem\" by Booker T. Washington et al. is a collection of essays and analyses concerning the challenges faced by the African American community in the post-Civil War United States, likely written in the late 19th century. This work features contributions from prominent figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Charles W. Chesnutt, and others, who explore themes such as education, disenfranchisement, and the socio-economic status of Black Americans. Each essay reflects on the historical context of race relations and proposes different paths forward for resolving the issues at hand.  The opening of the book begins with Booker T. Washingtonâ€™s essay, \"Industrial Education for the Negro,\" wherein he asserts the importance of practical industrial education as a foundation for economic stability and social progress within the African American community. Washington emphasizes the necessity for Black Americans to shift from merely being laborers to becoming skilled workers who can participate actively in the economic systems of their communities. He discusses the legacy of slavery, the importance of dignity in work, and the need for personal development through hands-on skills. Throughout this essay, Washington advocates for an educational approach that prioritizes trade skills while simultaneously recognizing the value of mental and moral training, setting the tone for the ensuing discussions on the multifaceted challenges surrounding the education and rights of African Americans.
