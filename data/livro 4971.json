    "resumo": "\"The Emerald City of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum is a children's fantasy novel written in the late 19th century. The story continues the adventures of Dorothy Gale as she interacts with beloved characters from the Land of Oz, such as Princess Ozma, the Cowardly Lion, and others, while facing threats from the vengeful Nome King. The novel explores themes of friendship, bravery, and the timeless allure of magical realms.  The opening portion of the book establishes the Nome King, Roquat the Red, as a villain who is frustrated by the loss of his Magic Belt, which grants him powers. As he plots revenge against the Emerald City of Oz, the narrative also introduces Dorothy, who is preparing to visit Ozma along with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, who are facing hardships on their Kansas farm. Dorothy's loyalty to her family and her past adventures in Oz highlight her resolve to help her loved ones, setting the stage for the intertwining storylines of military ambition from the Nome King and the magical journey of Dorothy and her family.
