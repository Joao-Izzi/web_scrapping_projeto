    "resumo": "\"La Tempesta\" by William Shakespeare is a theatrical play written in the early 17th century. This enigmatic work is filled with themes of magic, betrayal, and redemption, centering on the character Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, who uses his magical powers to orchestrate events on a mysterious island inhabited by spirits and an enigmatic creature named Caliban.   At the start of the play, a ship caught in a violent storm is being desperately maneuvered by the crew to avoid disaster. As the shipmates struggle against the tempest, we are introduced to Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, who have been living on the island after being exiled from their home. Prospero reveals his plan to use magic to precipitate the shipwreck, bringing his usurper brother Antonio and King Alonso of Naples to the island, hinting at a quest for vengeance and reconciliation. This opening sets the stage for a tale that interweaves themes of power, nature, and the complexities of human relationships against the backdrop of supernatural elements and political intrigue.
