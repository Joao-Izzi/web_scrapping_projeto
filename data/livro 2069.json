    "resumo": "\"Éléments de la philosophie de Neuton\" by Voltaire is a scientific publication written in the 18th century. This work serves as an accessible introduction to the philosophy and discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton, aiming to demystify complex scientific concepts for the general public. The text explores Newton's principles related to light, gravity, and motion, while also addressing misconceptions propagated by past philosophers.  At the start of the book, the author addresses the reader directly, explaining that the aim is to clarify truths from Newton's findings as a tribute to both Newton and the intellectual progress of the time. The opening includes a poetic homage to Newton intertwined with discussions of light and its properties, setting the tone for a rational exploration of nature's laws. Voltaire critiques former scientific notions, particularly those held by the ancients and contemporaries like Descartes, while asserting the necessity of empirical evidence in understanding natural phenomena. He emphasizes the need for clarity in the study of light, introducing the foundational concepts that will be elaborated throughout the text. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
