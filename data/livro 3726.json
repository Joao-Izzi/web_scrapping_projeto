    "resumo": "\"A Source-Book of English Social History\" by M. E. Monckton Jones is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work compiles various documents and laws from different periods of English social and economic life, spanning from Saxon times through the Industrial Revolution. It provides insights into the evolution of community living, legal frameworks, and the growth of trade and commerce in England.  The opening of the source-book emphasizes the importance of accessible historical evidence for students of history, moving away from solely relying on textbooks. The author introduces various laws from significant figures like Ethelbert, Ine, and Alfred to illustrate social norms and economic practices in early England. The text sets the groundwork by discussing the Saxon systems of governance and community laws, highlighting how these early regulations influenced later developments in English society and law. Through such laws, the opening portrays a vivid picture of life in Saxon villages, manorial systems, and the burgeoning complexity of social interaction in medieval England.
