    "resumo": "\"A Minor War History Compiled from a Soldier Boy's Letters to 'The Girl I Left Behind Me'\" is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work compiles letters from Martin A. Haynes, a soldier in the Second New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, to his beloved Cornelia T. Lane during the Civil War years of 1861 to 1864. The book chronicles the everyday experiences, thoughts, and emotions of a soldier, providing insights into the less heroic yet poignant aspects of military life.  The opening of this compilation introduces us to the context in which the letters were written. Martin A. Haynes reflects on his memories of camp life, the camaraderie with fellow soldiers, and the often humorous and mundane experiences of being in the army. His letters provide a vivid picture of military routines, interactions with comrades, the hardships faced, and his longing for home and his sweetheart. There's a sense of nostalgia and a desire to preserve the personal history of his time in service, which contrasts with the grand narratives of war typically documented. The letters serve as a testament to the quieter yet equally significant stories of soldiers, focusing on the trivialities and experiences that might otherwise be overlooked in the telling of history.
