    "resumo": "\"Andrew the Glad\" by Maria Thompson Daviess is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around Andrew Sevier, a man known for his charm and poetic sensibility, and the relationships that surround him, particularly his interactions with David Kildare and Phoebe Donelson, as well as the major and Mrs. Matilda.

The opening of the novel introduces a lively discourse between David Kildare and the major about Andrew, who has just returned from a traumatic experience in Panama that has left him physically injured but emotionally complex.

Meanwhile, the major reflects on Andrew's tragic past, hinting at the shadow of gambling and loss that looms over him. This foundation sets a tone of emotional depth and interpersonal drama, revealing not just the characters' connections but also the complexities of their desires and affections. As the story unfolds, readers are likely to find themselves immersed in a narrative filled with humor, warmth, and heartfelt exploration of the human condition.
