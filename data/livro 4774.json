    "resumo": "\"Le mari de madame de Solange\" by Émile Souvestre is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around madame de Solange, a woman of great ambition and influence who has effectively overshadowed her passive husband, M. de Solange, attempting to secure a prosperous future for their daughter, Jeanne. The narrative explores themes of ambition, control, and familial dynamics against a backdrop of French societal norms of the time.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to a conversation between M. de Lanoy, a young nobleman, and his notary, M. Durocher, discussing the assets and potential matrimonial prospects with madame de Solange. As the dialogue unfolds, it reveals madame de Solange's remarkable ambition to rise in status despite her humble origins. Meanwhile, the dynamics within the Solange family are further explored through the perspectives of the marquis and his daughter, Jeanne, who finds herself caught between her mother's aspirations and her own feelings for another suitor. This initial section sets the stage for an intricate tale of personal desires clashing with ambitions, established norms, and gender roles in pre-revolutionary France.
