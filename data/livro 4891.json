    "resumo": "\"A Publisher's Confession\" by Walter Hines Page is a detailed examination of the publishing industry, written in the early 20th century. The text delves into various aspects of publishing, focusing on economic challenges, relationships between authors and publishers, and the overall state of literature during that time. Page expresses concern over the commercialization of publishing practices and critiques the long-standing policies regarding author royalties, especially the trend of high percentage payments leading to financial impracticalities.  At the start of the book, the author presents a scenario in which a popular writer discusses contract terms with a publisher, highlighting the increasing pressure on publishers to give lucrative deals to authors. Page reflects on the unsustainable nature of high royalties, stressing that such practices disadvantage both the publisher and the author in the long run. He argues that while authors may be tempted by better rates elsewhere, a more stable and healthy relationship between authors and publishers is crucial for the success of books. The opening sets the tone for a candid exploration of the complexities within the book publishing business, suggesting that both efficiency and loyalty are paramount for maintaining the integrity of literary production.
