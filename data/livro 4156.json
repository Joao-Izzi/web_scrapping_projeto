    "resumo": "\"Galatea\" by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is a pastoral novel written in the late 16th century. The story is centered around the themes of unrequited love and romantic ideals, focusing on the character Elicio and his affection for Galatea. This early work by Cervantes reflects his experimentation with literary forms, particularly in the context of the popular pastoral genre of the time.  The opening of \"Galatea\" serves as an introduction to the characters and the setting of this pastoral tale. It presents Elicio, a shepherd hopelessly in love with Galatea, whose beauty and grace captivate him. The narrative also hints at a complex web of romantic relationships among the shepherds and nymphs, establishing a tone that blends lyrical poetry with melodramatic elements typical of pastoral literature. Overall, the beginning sets the stage for exploring themes of love and longing against a backdrop of idyllic pastoral life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
