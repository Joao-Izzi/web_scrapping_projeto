    "resumo": "\"The Satires of A. Persius Flaccus\" by Persius is a collection of satirical poems written in the 1st century AD. This work reflects the authorâ€™s sharp critique of society, particularly targeting moral and social decay in Rome. It explores themes of virtue, vice, and the hypocrisy of contemporary Roman life, with a focus on moral philosophy and Stoicism.  The opening of \"The Satires\" introduces readers to Persius's distinctive style, characterized by wit and biting humor. In the prologue and first satire, he raises questions about the worth of poetry and the motives behind his writing, addressing both societal issues and personal struggles. He critiques the superficiality of popular poetry and reflects on the disconnection between the ideals of philosophy and the practices of his contemporaries. Persius employs vivid imagery and rhetorical questions, setting the tone for a scathing examination of the moral landscape of his time, all while establishing his unique voice amidst the literary lineage of Roman satire.
