    "resumo": "\"La Francia dal primo impero al 1871. Volume 2\" by Heinrich von Treitschke is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the intricate political and social upheavals in France during the turbulent period between the first empire and the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871. It closely examines key events and revolutions, such as those of February 1848, and the complex conflicts between different societal classes in France, including the role of radicalism and the quest for national unity.  The opening of this volume discusses the chaotic aftermath of Napoleon's return from Moscow and the subsequent revolution. It recounts the rise of General Mallet, who briefly attempted to establish a provisional government amidst the disarray, drawing attention to the fragility of France's parliamentary life and the despotic nature of its governance. It further notes how societal dissatisfaction led to revolts, ultimately culminating in failed attempts at establishing a stable republic. Through this, Treitschke presents a critical view of the revolutionary events, suggesting that they were marked more by chaos and the egotism of various political factions than by a genuine quest for liberty and stability. Overall, the text sets a somber tone regarding the challenges of governance and societal unity in France during this tumultuous era. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
