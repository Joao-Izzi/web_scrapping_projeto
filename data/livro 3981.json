    "resumo": "\"Prime Difference\" by Alan Edward Nourse is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story centers around the personal dilemmas of George Faircloth, a man who becomes increasingly disenchanted with his turbulent marriage. In a society where divorce has become prohibitively difficult due to stringent laws, George turns to an illegal technology that creates a duplicate of himself, an \"Ego Prime,\" to handle his domestic life while he explores extramarital affairs.  The plot unfolds as George uses his Ego Prime to navigate his frustrations with his wife, Marge, while indulging in newfound freedom. However, as the Ego Prime begins to develop a personality of its own, George finds himself entangled in unforeseen complications, including Marge's unexpected admiration for the Prime. Ultimately, the story explores themes of identity, marriage, and the moral implications of technology, culminating in an ironic twist that challenges Georgeâ€™s perceptions about love and companionship. As the narrative concludes, the distinction between human and machine becomes blurred, revealing deeper insights into relationships and personal fulfillment.
