    "resumo": "\"Reminiscences of Anton Chekhov\" by Maxim Gorky, Alexander Kuprin, and I.A. Bunin is a collection of personal reflections and anecdotes about the celebrated Russian writer Anton Chekhov, written in the early 20th century. This work serves to shed light on Chekhov's character, literary philosophy, and the impact he had on those around him, particularly the writers and intellectuals of his time. The recollections encompass both fond memories and insightful observations, celebrating Chekhov's unique approach to life and literature.  At the start of the memoirs, Maxim Gorky offers a vivid portrayal of a visit he made to Chekhov's estate, where the latter shared his thoughts on the role of teachers in Russian society and the pressing need for educational reform. Chekhovâ€™s genuine compassion for those in the teaching profession is evident as he reflects on their struggles and dignity. The opening chapter sets the tone for a deeper exploration of Chekhov's kind-heartedness, intelligence, and his ability to draw out simplicity and truth from those around him. The sincere interactions he has with his guests suggest a man deeply engaged with the lives of others, as well as a discerning observer of both the absurdities and the beauty of human existence.
