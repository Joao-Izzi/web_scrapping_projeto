    "resumo": "\"Five Pebbles from the Brook\" by George Bethune English is a theological work written in the early 19th century that serves as a critique and response to Edward Everett's \"A Defence of Christianity.\" The author engages with the themes of biblical authority and the historical credibility of the New Testament, positioned against the Old Testament. English's fundamental aim appears to be to defend the integrity of the Old Testament against what he perceives as the inadequacies and contradictions found within the New Testament narratives.  At the start of the work, English outlines his intent to address the arguments presented by Everett, declaring that a proper understanding of the Old Testament as a foundational text is crucial for the evaluation of the New Testament. He discusses his philosophical journey and the reasons behind the rejection of the New Testament's claims, focusing on alleged discrepancies in the Gospels, particularly those concerning the miracles of Jesus and their implications concerning his messiahship. English articulates a systematic critique of the biblical texts, aiming to demonstrate inconsistencies and challenges to the divine authority claimed by the New Testament, while emphasizing the perceived reliability of the Old Testament as a true revelation from God.
