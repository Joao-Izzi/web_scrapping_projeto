    "resumo": "\"Our Lady Saint Mary\" by J. G. H. Barry is a devotional exploration written during the early 20th century. This work is structured as a collection of sermons, with a focus on the life of the Virgin Mary and her significance within the Christian faith, particularly emphasizing the Catholic tradition. The author offers a profound reflection on Mary’s role as the Mother of God, addressing aspects of her life and how she embodies faith and humanity’s relationship with divinity.  The opening of the book sets a contemplative tone, discussing themes of loyalty to the Anglican Communion and the broader human struggle for unity against increasing nationalism and localism in both church and society. Barry reflects on the essential nature of worship and the need for a renewed understanding of devotional practices dedicated to Mary. He frames the narrative within a theological discourse, pondering aspects of worship, humility, and the heart of Mary’s acceptance of God’s will, which leads to her pivotal role in the Incarnation. This introduction indicates that readers will engage with both historical accounts and theological insights as they journey through the life and virtues of Mary.
