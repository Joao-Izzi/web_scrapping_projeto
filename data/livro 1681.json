    "resumo": "\"The Mentor\" by Alfred Ayres is a guidebook on social etiquette and manners written in the late 19th century. The book serves as a manual for men and boys aiming to present themselves favorably in society, particularly among those of higher social standing. It emphasizes the importance of cultural refinement, proper behavior, and the art of conversation as key components to being perceived as a gentleman.  At the start of the book, the author lays the groundwork for understanding the value of manners, asserting that a successful social presence requires knowledge of cultural norms and practices. The opening portion discusses the need for personal appearance, including dress, grooming, and the necessity of adhering to societal expectations. Ayres argues that more than wealth, it is moral worth and education that earn one acceptance in refined circles, and he offers practical advice on various aspects such as dress codes and dining etiquette as the reader prepares to navigate social situations.
