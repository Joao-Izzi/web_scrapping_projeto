    "resumo": "\"Pranto de Maria Parda\" by Gil Vicente is a satirical play written during the early 16th century. The book reflects on the social customs and issues related to alcohol consumption in Portugal, particularly in the context of taverns and the lives of the common people in Lisbon. It is structured around the lamentations of the titular character, Maria Parda, expressing her despair over the scarcity of wine and the changes in the city.  The play features Maria Parda as she mourns the loss of the vibrancy of Lisbon's taverns and the high prices of wine that leave her and her companions in dismay. Through her humorous yet poignant verses, Maria engages in conversations with various characters, revealing the struggles of the poor and their reliance on alcohol for pleasure amidst economic hardship. The narrative serves as a critique of the societal issues of the time, intertwining themes of desperation, camaraderie, and the bittersweet nature of life in a bustling urban environment, while also offering a glimpse into the cultural values surrounding drinking in 16th-century Portugal.
