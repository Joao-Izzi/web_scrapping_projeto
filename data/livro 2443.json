    "resumo": "\"Le voyage imprévu : roman\" by Tristan Bernard is a fictional novel likely written in the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around Georges Gassy, a somewhat idle and unanchored man in his mid-thirties, who unexpectedly finds himself drawn into an adventure that promises romance and escape from the mundane. This element of surprise sets the stage for a journey that intertwines his fate with that of the mysterious Mme Olmey, sparking curiosity about how their paths will evolve.  At the start of the novel, Georges returns home after a late-night bridge game, only to discover an enigmatic letter from Mme Olmey, arranging to pick him up for an undisclosed journey the next morning. Intrigued, he prepares for the unexpected trip, while reflecting on his past feelings for her. The opening sets an atmosphere of anticipation as Georges, accompanied by Mme Olmey and her friend Laurence, embarks on their journey but soon encounters complications when their car breaks down. This disruption hints at deeper, potentially darker elements ahead, as it becomes apparent that something is amiss regarding Mme Olmey’s past, including her recently deceased beau-frère, raising questions about the true nature of their adventure.
