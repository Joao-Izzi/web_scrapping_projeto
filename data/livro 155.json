    "resumo": "\"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Part 13\" by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is a classic novel written in the early 17th century. The book continues the saga of Don Quixote, an aging nobleman who, influenced by chivalric romances, sets out on absurd adventures as a self-proclaimed knight-errant. In this part, a subplot, titled \"The Novel of the Ill-Advised Curiosity,\" revolves around the misguided actions of two friends, Anselmo and Lothario, as Anselmo's foolish desire to test the virtue of his wife, Camilla, leads to disastrous consequences.  At the start of this portion, Anselmo confides in Lothario about his troubling urge to prove Camilla’s fidelity, suggesting he would like Lothario to woo her as a way to test her. Despite Lothario’s refusal and strong arguments against such a foolish plan, the pressure of their friendship convinces him to go along with Anselmo's ill-conceived scheme. This sets off a chain of misunderstandings and infidelity, revealing how Anselmo's obsession with proof of virtue jeopardizes his marriage and friendship. The opening highlights Anselmo's internal conflict and the friendship between him and Lothario, leading to relational strife and the unraveling of trust between the characters.
