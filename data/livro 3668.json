    "resumo": "\"Si Klegg, Book 3\" by John McElroy is a historical fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the adventures of Si Klegg, a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and his companion, Shorty, as they encounter various challenges, including espionage and humor in the midst of war. The book delves into themes of camaraderie, bravery, and the absurdity of military life through the eyes of ordinary soldiers.  At the start of the narrative, Si is on picket duty with Shorty and their friend, the Deacon. The men engage in lighthearted banter while setting up their camp and preparing a meal.
