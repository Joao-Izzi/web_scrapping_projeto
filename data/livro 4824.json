    "resumo": "\"Disunion and Restoration in Tennessee\" by John Randolph Neal is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work examines the political and social dynamics surrounding Tennessee's secession from the Union during the Civil War and its subsequent reintegration into the United States. It examines the motivations behind secession, focusing on figures like Governor Isham G. Harris and the division of sentiments in different regions of the state, particularly addressing the complex attitudes toward slavery and unionism.  At the start of the work, Neal introduces the political climate in Tennessee on the eve of the Civil War, noting that the state initially displayed a majority against disunion sentiments during the 1860 presidential election. He elaborates on Governor Harrisâ€™s role in urging secession, citing his historical context of party struggles and responses to increasing tensions with Northern states. The opening progresses through a discussion of the failed initial attempts at secession, public votes, and the eventual pull of war that reframed loyalties and sentiments within the state, setting the stage for the broader discussions of conflict and reconstruction that follow throughout the text.
