    "resumo": "\"Dagen\" by Stijn Streuvels is a novel written during the early 20th century. The story unfolds in a rural setting, capturing the lives of its characters, especially focusing on Doka and Ghielen, as they navigate the challenges of old age, the struggles of farming, and the pressing issues surrounding their prized cow that refuses to calf. The narrative paints a picture of their daily existence, illustrating their hopes, disappointments, and the stark realities of life.  The opening of the novel introduces readers to the oppressive atmosphere of a harsh winter, as Doka lies in her warm bed reflecting on happier summer days while anxiously waiting for their cow to give birth. As the couple endures a seemingly endless wait, their conversations reveal their frustrations and fears regarding the cow's wellbeing and whether they should part with it to relieve their burdens. The tension mounts not only from the cow's condition but also from the couple's aging and dwindling resources, establishing a sense of unease that permeates their lives. As they contemplate selling the cow, their discussions lead to deeper reflections on their lives, their dreams, and the inevitable passage of time. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
