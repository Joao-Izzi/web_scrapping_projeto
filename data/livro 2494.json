    "resumo": "\"Christmas Stories And Legends\" by Phebe A. Curtiss is a collection of Christmas-themed tales and legends compiled in the early 20th century. The book encompasses various stories that celebrate the spirit of Christmas through themes of generosity, kindness, and the significance of the holiday, centering around traditional figures such as the Christ child, Santa Claus, and beloved characters from folklore.   The opening portion of the collection includes an insightful Foreword that discusses the power of storytelling, particularly in connection with the Christmas narrative. It introduces the first story, \"The Legend of the 'White Gifts,'\" which revolves around a beloved king who is celebrated by his subjects through heartfelt gifts symbolic of their pure love. Each gift must be \"white,\" representing unselfishness and sincerity, demonstrating the theme that the value of a gift lies not in its material worth but in the love and intention behind it. The king's reaction to the diversity of gifts underscores the universal message of love and acceptance that permeates throughout the stories. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
