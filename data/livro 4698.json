    "resumo": "\"Climate—disordered\" by Carter Sprague is a satirical science fiction story published in the mid-20th century. The narrative centers on a public relations expert, Wiley Cordes, who devises a scheme to manipulate weather patterns to create snowstorms over a rival resort city, Burden Bay. The underlying topic explores themes of competition, ethics, and the lengths to which individuals may go for success in the business world.  In the story, Wiley Cordes is hired by the Chamber of Commerce in Wheedonville by the Sea to increase its tourist trade, which has suffered due to a series of unfortunate events impacting the town. Utilizing his expertise in promotion, he decides to artificially induce snow in Burden Bay to divert attention and vacationers to Wheedonville. For a time, his plan succeeds, and the town enjoys a thriving tourist season at the expense of Burden Bay. However, Cordes's success is short-lived; eventually, his tactics backfire when the rival town adopts his weather manipulation idea for themselves, leaving Cordes and Wheedonville out in the cold, both literally and figuratively. The story offers a humorous yet cautionary look at ambition and rivalry in the resort industry. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
