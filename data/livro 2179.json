    "resumo": "\"The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg\" by Mark Twain is a satirical novella that fits into the genre of social commentary fiction, likely written in the late 19th century. It revolves around the fictitious town of Hadleyburg, celebrated for its supposed incorruptibility and unblemished honesty, only to have that reputation put to the test when a stranger's malicious plan threatens to expose the hypocrisy lurking beneath its prided fa√ßade. The story follows key characters, including Mr. and Mrs. Richards, who find themselves grappling with temptation and moral decline as they become integral to the unfolding drama.  The opening of the novella sets the stage by establishing Hadleyburg as a community proud of its virtuous reputation, which has persisted for generations. However, an unexpected encounter with a stranger ignites a series of events leading to the introduction of a sack filled with gold coins, purportedly meant for a good Samaritan who once aided the stranger. Mr. and Mrs. Richards, consumed by the allure of wealth and recognition, become enmeshed in the implications of the strangers' challenge while grappling with their own moral dilemmas. As the town prepares for a public inquiry to identify the anonymous benefactor, the ensuing chaos and revelations begin to peel away the layers of Hadleyburg's pretentious purity, hinting at the broader themes of human nature, pride, and the vulnerability of so-called virtues to greed and corruption.
