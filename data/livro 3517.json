    "resumo": "\"How Women May Earn a Living\" by Mercy Grogan is a practical guide written in the late 19th century. The work aims to empower women by outlining various occupations available to them at a time when many were beginning to shift towards financial independence. Using a combination of advice, information, and insights, it highlights the challenges women faced in securing employment and asserts the importance of education and vocational training.  The opening portion of the book introduces the prevailing social issue of women needing to support themselves due to a significant gender imbalance in the workforce. It emphasizes the necessity for women to be educated and prepared for various professions to foster their independence. Grogan outlines her purpose for the work, which includes directing women to suitable employment opportunities, encouraging them to undertake occupations not widely recognized or respected, and combating societal perceptions regarding women's roles. The text also suggests that practical skills, industry, and perseverance are crucial for overcoming the barriers women encounter in their pursuit of meaningful work.
