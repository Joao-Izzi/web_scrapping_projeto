    "resumo": "\"The Rocky Mountain Goat\" by Madison Grant is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book examines the Rocky Mountain goat, a lesser-known North American game animal, delving into its biological characteristics, habitat, and the confusion that surrounds its classification. Grant, who served as the secretary of the New York Zoological Society, uses his expertise to illuminate the unique qualities of this species, which is often misidentified due to its remote and rugged living conditions.  In this work, Grant provides a thorough overview of the Rocky Mountain goat, covering its physical attributes, habitat preferences, and subspecies distinctions. He contrasts the goat with other mountain-dwelling animals, like sheep, highlighting the differences in their behaviors and environments. The text emphasizes the crucial need for protection of these animals from overhunting and habitat encroachment, and elaborates on the challenges they face, including competition for resources and changing landscape dynamics. Overall, the book serves as a detailed reference for understanding the ecological and conservation issues surrounding the Rocky Mountain goat. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
