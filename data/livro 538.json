    "resumo": "\"Les Contemplations: Autrefois, 1830-1843\" by Victor Hugo is a collection of lyric poetry written in the mid-19th century. This work is a profound meditation on life, love, and loss, reflecting on the human experience and the passage of time. Hugo's verses convey deep emotional resonance as he navigates themes of individual suffering while simultaneously connecting it to universal truths about humanity.  The opening of the collection sets the tone for what is to follow. It begins with a reflective and guiding preface from Hugo, urging readers to approach the text as one might read the thoughts of a departed soul. It is suggested that these poems capture the essence of a life livedâ€”an amalgamation of memories, experiences, and philosophical ruminations that echo the joy and sorrow inherent in existence. The first poem introduces a metaphor of the sea, likening nature's elements to God, before transitioning into verses addressed to the poet's daughter, blending personal reflection with broader existential musings. This initial glimpse into the collection reveals Hugo's intricate weaving of personal narrative within a grander meditation on life itself, inviting readers to find their own reflections within his lyrical expressions.
