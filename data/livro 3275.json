    "resumo": "\"A Ride With A Mad Horse In A Freight-Car\" by W. H. H. Murray is a vivid narrative and war memoir written in the late 19th century. This book encapsulates the personal experiences of the author during the American Civil War, focusing on the bond he shares with a horse named Gulnare against the backdrop of war. It explores themes of companionship, loyalty, and the emotional turmoil of battle while delving into the tragic fate of both horse and rider.  The story begins with the author recalling a fierce battle at Malvern Hill, where he is injured and encounters a beautiful, riderless mare amidst the chaos. He names her Gulnare, and a deep bond forms between them over the course of the war. This connection is emphasized through his tender care and their shared experiences, as she accompanies him through battles and personal struggles. However, the narrative takes a heart-wrenching turn as Gulnare contracts phrenitis during their journey home, spiraling into madness. The vivid descriptions of her suffering, coupled with the author's desperate attempts to save her, culminate in a poignant farewell as he holds her in his lap as she dies. The book ultimately reflects on the profound impact of love and loss, leaving readers with a bittersweet sense of the sacrifices made in war. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
