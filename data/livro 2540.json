    "resumo": "\"Faithfully Yours\" by Lou Tabakow is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century, specifically in the 1950s. The story explores themes of escape, survival, and the complexities of identity in a futuristic setting, blending elements of suspense and adventure as it raises questions about what it means to be hunted, both by external forces and within oneâ€™s own psyche.  The narrative follows Tee Ormond, a fugitive and skilled pilot, who escapes from a high-tech prison known as Hades. As Tee struggles with his past and the relentless pursuit of a bloodhound-like technology hunting him across the galaxy, he finds himself entangled in a web of desperation and fear. After crash-landing on the idyllic planet of Elysia, he encounters Lara, who offers him solace but also introduces new emotional conflicts. Ultimately, Tee grapples with his choice between the pursuit of freedom and the hidden shackles of his past as his tale unfolds, leading to moments of introspection and tension, culminating in a climactic conclusion that challenges his conception of escape and identity.
