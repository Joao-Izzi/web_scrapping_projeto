    "resumo": "\"In Korea with Marquis Ito\" by George Trumbull Ladd is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It chronicles the author's personal experiences and observations during his time in Korea, particularly focusing on the interactions and efforts of Marquis Ito, a significant figure in Korean-Japanese relations during Japan's protection over Korea. The work aims to illuminate the complexities of the relationship between Japan and Korea at a pivotal moment in history.  The opening of the book details the author's journey from New Haven to Japan and the circumstances surrounding his invitation to Korea by Marquis Ito. Ladd describes his travel experiences, the hospitality he received upon arrival in Japan, and the implications of his role as an observer and potential intermediary in the tense relations between Koreans and the Japanese administration. Through personal anecdotes and encounters, Ladd sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the intertwining issues of identity, diplomacy, and cultural relations that he will address in his subsequent activities and writings during his stay in Korea.
