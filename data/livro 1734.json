    "resumo": "\"Dogs Always Know\" by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding is a romantic short story written in the early 20th century. This narrative unfolds a tale of misunderstanding and unexpected connections between two seemingly incompatible characters, set against the backdrop of a boarding house. The likely topic of the book revolves around love, emotional barriers, and the role of animals in bridging human interactions, all delivered with a touch of humor and social commentary.  The story follows Miss Selby, a reserved young woman from Boston, and Mr. Anderson, a charming but awkward man from New York, who find themselves in a boarding house where they initially struggle to like each other. Their relationship evolves through a series of encounters, misunderstandings, and shared experiences, peppered with insights about loneliness and connection. When a dog named Sandy brings them together under humorous and chaotic circumstances, their friction slowly gives way to fondness, leading them to realize their mutual feelings. However, their journey is not without complications, particularly with the meddling of a well-meaning neighbor and the strain of social expectations. Ultimately, the story explores how love can flourish in unexpected ways, accentuated by the instinctive bond shared between humans and animals. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
