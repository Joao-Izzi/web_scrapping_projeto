    "resumo": "\"Summa Theologica, Part I (Prima Pars)\" by Saint Thomas Aquinas is a philosophical theological treatise written in the 13th century. This seminal work is a foundational text in Christian theology and philosophy, systematically addressing fundamental questions regarding God, creation, and humanity's relationship with the divine. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Christian faith through logical argumentation and exposition of doctrine.  The opening portion of the text establishes its aim to instruct both beginners and advanced scholars in the Christian faith by clarifying the nature and scope of sacred doctrine. Aquinas emphasizes the necessity of revelation for human salvation and asserts that sacred science is superior to philosophical science, as it is founded on divine revelation rather than human reasoning alone. He presents a structured inquiry into the nature of sacred doctrine, contemplating its necessity, its unity as a science, the relationship it shares with philosophy, and its role in guiding individuals toward understanding the divine. This prologue sets the stage for an in-depth examination of God's existence, essence, and attributes, ultimately laying a thorough groundwork for the exploration of theology.
