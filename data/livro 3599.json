    "resumo": "\"Die griechische Tänzerin, und andere Novellen\" by Arthur Schnitzler is a collection of novellas written in the late 19th century. This work explores complex themes of human relationships, loss, and emotional turmoil, as evidenced by its opening story featuring characters grappling with poverty, familial duty, and the haunting shadow of a tragic past. The narrative intricately weaves the lives of two brothers, Geronimo, a blind beggar, and Carlo, his devoted caretaker, against a backdrop of societal indifference and personal despair.  The beginning of the collection focuses on the brothers’ life as beggars traveling along a busy street, where they struggle with their harsh reality. Geronimo, though blind, shows a keen awareness of his surroundings and reacts to events with a mix of spontaneous singing and raw emotion, while Carlo feels the weight of his brother’s dependency and distrust growing. Their interactions reveal a deep bond shaped by years of shared hardship, but also hint at an underlying tension as Geronimo begins to suspect Carlo of theft based on a stranger’s words. As they navigate their challenging life on the streets, the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the search for dignity emerge, setting a poignant tone for the stories that follow.
