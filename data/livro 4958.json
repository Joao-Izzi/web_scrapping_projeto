    "resumo": "\"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex\" by Sigmund Freud is a scientific publication written during the late 19th century, though it was translated and reprinted in the early 20th century. This foundational work delves into Freud's theories on human sexuality, including abnormal sexual behaviors, infantile sexuality, and how these elements influence adult sexual behavior and neuroses.   The opening of this influential text frames Freud's exploration of sexual drives through a critique of prevailing assumptions about the sexual impulse, particularly the notion that it is absent in childhood. Freud introduces the concept of the sexual impulse as analogous to hunger, highlighting a spectrum of sexual deviations and the complexities surrounding them. He explores categories such as inversion (homosexuality), lust directed towards immature individuals, and animals. Additionally, he underscores the importance of early sexual experiences, asserting that the implications of childhood sexuality significantly shape future desires and behaviors, creating a foundation for the rest of his arguments and observations in the text.
