    "resumo": "\"Cursed\" by George Allan England is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in a stirring maritime environment and follows the turbulent events aboard the ship \"Silver Fleece\", captained by the ruthless Alpheus Briggs. The plot unfolds in the Malay Straits, exploring themes of colonialism, superstition, and conflict between cultures. The characters grapple with moral complexities and mutiny, particularly focusing on the tensions surrounding the abduction of a native girl, Kuala Pahang, and the ensuing consequences.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to the setting at Batu Kawan, where the \"Silver Fleece\" is delayed for departure, and the mate, William Scurlock, expresses his frustrations regarding their captain’s reckless behavior. The opening portion establishes the mounting tensions aboard the ship as Scurlock confronts the captain, leading to a violent fallout. Briggs’s volatile nature and his interactions with the crew reveal a brewing conflict fueled by drunkenness and aggression. Simultaneously, the arrival of a witch-woman sets the stage for supernatural elements as she places a curse on the ship, hinting at the impending chaos. As the narrative progresses, the themes of survival and cultural clashes heighten, foreshadowing a dramatic confrontation with local forces intent on rescuing their kin.
