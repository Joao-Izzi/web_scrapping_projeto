The opening of this work introduces the authorâ€™s reflections on his role as a lecturer, emphasizing his commitment to teaching the fundamental principles of art and engraving. Ruskin candidly addresses the challenges he faces in his teaching journey, lamenting the limited attendance in his class but expressing a sincere desire to impart knowledge. He begins by explaining the essence of engraving, distinguishing its techniques from other artistic practices, and outlining a structured approach to understanding the art form. Through his thoughtful discourse, Ruskin aspires to elevate engraving by situating it within the broader narrative of artistic development and education, emphasizing its importance as a precursor to forms of architecture and sculpture.
