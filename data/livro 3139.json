    "resumo": "\"The Soul of Democracy\" by Edward Howard Griggs is a philosophical examination of the principles and ideals underpinning democracy in the context of the World War, written in the early 20th century. The work reflects on the trajectory of human liberty as it intersects with national struggles, aiming to articulate the essence of what makes a true democracy and its potential future in a world reshaped by conflict.  The opening of the book presents a poignant reflection on the profound tragedy of World War I and its implications for humanity. Griggs argues that the war has forced all people to confront uncomfortable truths about civilization and the fundamental nature of democratic ideals. He emphasizes the need for a reevaluation of moral standards and the relationship between the individual and the state, suggesting that true democracy must extend beyond mere political forms into the fabric of daily life. As history is being rewritten amidst the ruins of war, Griggs insists that a deeper understanding and commitment to democratic values are essential if society hopes to emerge from the conflict stronger and more unified.
