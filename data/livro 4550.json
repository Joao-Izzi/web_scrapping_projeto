    "resumo": "\"The Woodman: A Romance of the Times of Richard III\" by G. P. R. James is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. The narrative is set during the tumultuous period of Richard III's reign, intertwining themes of romance, conflict, and social dynamics through the actions of its diverse characters. The plot seems to center around John Boyd, the woodman, who finds himself at the intersection of political intrigue and personal relationships within the abbey.  The opening of the novel begins with poetic descriptions of a moonlit landscape where an eerie calm settles after a battle, hinting at the local struggles and violence connected to the era. As the narrative progresses, we are introduced to the abbess of Atherston, a foil of cheerfulness and simplicity in contrast to the violent backdrop surrounding her convent. She receives visitors, including Lord Chartley and his companions, amidst fears of hunting by Richardâ€™s followers. These early chapters set the stage for a complex interplay of loyalty, the pursuit of power, and the impact of civil strife on personal lives, foreshadowing deeper connections as the plot unfolds.
