    "resumo": "\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" by Joy Leache is a science fiction novella that first appeared in \"Galaxy Magazine\" in the early 1960s. The story centers on interstellar promotions and the quirky challenges faced by a fledgling promoter, Andrew Stephens, as he navigates the complexities of selling a struggling planet, Felix II, to the Galactic Federation. The backdrop of the narrative captures the blend of humorous social commentary and speculative technology characteristic of mid-20th century science fiction.  The plot follows Andrew Stephens and his steno, Edith Featherpenny, as they attempt to secure the admission of the isolated planet Felix II into the Galactic Federation. Faced with unique cultural and political hurdles posed by the diminutive Felicians, who pride themselves on their quaint customs and lack of industrial advancement, Andrew grapples with the mandate to demonstrate that Felix II can offer something valuable. As they explore various potential exports, from tourism to traditional shoes, Andrew must confront his own insecurities and the amusing realities of the Felician way of life. Through a series of comedic misadventures and unexpected revelations about the Feliciansâ€™ dexterity and unique standing in the galaxy, the story ultimately reveals a clever solution to their economic stagnation, blending themes of innovation, community, and the often absurd nature of intergalactic trade.
