    "resumo": "\"The Mormons and the Theatre; or, The History of Theatricals in Utah\" by John S. Lindsay is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the unique relationship between Mormon culture and theatrical practices, particularly in Utah, highlighting the early prominence of theatre within a religious community usually characterized by conservative values. It delves into how figures like Brigham Young facilitated and promoted theatrical entertainment among Mormons, presenting a narrative of religious life intertwined with the performing arts.  The beginning of the book establishes the groundwork for an exploration of Mormon theatre, opening with a description of their enthusiasm for dancing and plays, which contrasts sharply with the practices of many other Christian denominations. It highlights key moments and figures, such as Brigham Youngâ€™s personal involvement in dance and theatre that helped foster this culture. The narrative unfolds with anecdotes of Thomas A. Lyne, an actor who became converted to Mormonism and played a significant role in early theatrical productions. Through these accounts, Lindsay sets the stage for a deeper examination of how theatrical expression evolved within the Mormon community and the sociocultural significance it held in their society.
