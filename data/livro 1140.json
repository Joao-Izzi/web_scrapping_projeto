    "resumo": "\"The Carnivore\" by G. A. Morris is a science fiction short story published in the early to mid-20th century. The narrative explores themes of alien encounters, survival, and the consequences of humanity's violent history. Through the lens of the protagonist's experience of devastation and loss, the story raises profound questions about civilization, morality, and the nature of fear.  In the wake of a catastrophic event that has decimated humanity, the protagonist awakens to find themselves surrounded by extraterrestrial beings who represent advanced, peaceful civilizations. As they interact, the protagonist grapples with feelings of anger and betrayal, questioning why these aliens failed to intervene during humanity's self-destruction. The aliens reveal their deep-seated fear of carnivorous species, having witnessed the brutality and harm caused by such beings throughout their history. In a shocking twist, it is revealed that the survivors have been rendered sterile, ensuring that the human race cannot continue. This conclusion forces the protagonist to confront a visceral rage against the aliens, juxtaposed with a burgeoning understanding of their cautious nature and the cycle of violence inherent in the evolutionary history of carnivores.
