    "resumo": "\"Christmas Every Day and Other Stories\" by William Dean Howells is a collection of children's stories written in the late 19th century. The title story introduces a little girl who desires Christmas to occur every day of the year, leading to whimsical and comedic situations that challenge the nature of joy and excess. Through her adventures, readers explore themes of love, family, and the consequences of greed, as the little girl learns the importance of moderation and appreciation for the holiday spirit.  The opening of the collection sets the stage with the little girl eagerly asking her father for a story, eventually guiding him to tell her about a fairy who grants her wish for everlasting Christmas. Initially excited, the little girl enjoys her daily dose of Christmas festivities, but as the days stretch on, the joy becomes overwhelming and burdensome for her and her family. As they face the chaos of unending holiday celebrations, the story humorously illustrates how the little girl grapples with the consequences of her wish, ultimately leading her to reconsider her desires in a heartwarming conclusion.
