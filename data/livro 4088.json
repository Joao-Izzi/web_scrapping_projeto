    "resumo": "\"Call Mr. Fortune\" by H. C. Bailey is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Dr. Reginald Fortune, a general practitioner who often finds himself entangled in criminal investigations due to his diverse knowledge and keen observational skills. The novel opens with a tense incident involving the Archduke Maurice, who has been knocked unconscious in a mysterious accident, setting the stage for intrigue and murder.  At the start of the book, Dr. Reginald Fortune reflects on his life and practice while preparing to take over his father’s medical duties in Westhampton. Shortly after, he receives a call to attend to the Archduke, who has been struck by a motor vehicle. Upon his arrival, Fortune discovers that the situation is more complex than it appears—the body of a second man lies nearby, creating questions about the accident.
