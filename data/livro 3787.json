    "resumo": "\"Sicherer Wegweiser zu einer guten und gesunden Wohnung\" by Theod. Meyer-Merian and J. J. Balmer-Rinck is a guidebook written in the mid-19th century. The book addresses the pressing issues surrounding housing conditions and the increasing rents during a time of urbanization and industrial growth. It aims to provide insights into creating healthy living spaces and highlights the relationship between housing quality and the well-being of its inhabitants.  The beginning of the book focuses on the struggles faced by individuals and families in finding affordable and decent housing amidst rising rents and overcrowded living conditions. It describes the deteriorating factors of poorly constructed homes, such as lack of light, ventilation, and cleanliness, all contributing to an unhealthy environment. The authors introduce the contrasts between model worker housing and traditional, substandard living conditions, emphasizing that many tenants endure appalling situations while still paying high rents. In this introductory portion, a family portrait emerges, reflecting the emotional and physical toll that such living situations can exert on family dynamics and health.
