    "resumo": "\"What We Saw in Egypt\" by Anonymous is a richly illustrated travel narrative possibly written during the late 19th century. The book recounts the adventures of a group of travelers, focusing primarily on two children, Hugh and Lucy, as they explore Egypt, including the vast deserts, bustling cities, and ancient monuments. With a blend of observations and reflections, the narrative captures the essence of the Egyptian landscape, people, and culture through the eyes of its young protagonists.  The opening of the book introduces the readers to the group as they embark on a journey from Suez to Cairo, highlighting their experiences crossing the Suez Desert in horse-drawn vans. Scenes described include the travelers' excitement upon arriving in Egypt, their musings about the biblical history surrounding them, and the simple joys of finding comfort during their travels. As they transition from the desolate sands of the desert to the vibrant city of Cairo, the tone shifts to one of anticipation, as the children express eagerness for the adventure that lies ahead, and the promise of encounters with iconic sights such as the pyramids and the bustling bazaars of Cairo.
