    "resumo": "\"The Affair at the Inn\" by Kate Douglas Wiggin, Mary Findlater, Jane Findlater, and Allan McAulay is a collaborative fiction work written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around a set of interconnected stories featuring characters who converge at a quaint inn on Dartmoor in Devonshire, providing a humorous examination of human relationships and the quirks of societal norms. The main characters include Virginia Pomeroy, a spirited American girl looking for amusement; Mrs. MacGill, a rather dull and hypochondriac Englishwoman; and Sir Archibald Maxwell Mackenzie, an aloof young man from Scotland, whose interactions with these women drive much of the plot's comedic tension.  The opening of the story sets the stage for this charming comedy by introducing Virginia Pomeroy as she travels with her mother in the wake of her father's death. As they arrive at Grey Tor Inn, they encounter fellow guests including the chatty Mrs. MacGill, her subdued companion Cecilia Evesham, and the indifferent Sir Archibald. Virginia's lively commentary and observations about the other inhabitants highlight her eagerness for connection and the challenges posed by her more reserved companions. The interplay of characters progresses through shared meals, awkward conversations, and budding friendships, particularly between Virginia and Sir Archibald, who initially seems unimpressed by her vivacity but is slowly drawn into the unfolding dynamics of inn life.
