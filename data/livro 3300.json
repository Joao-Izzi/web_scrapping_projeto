    "resumo": "\"The World English Bible (WEB): Deuteronomy\" by Anonymous is a religious text that forms a part of the biblical canon, traditionally attributed to Moses, likely composed during the early period of Israel's history as a people, around the time of the Israelites' entry into the Promised Land. This work serves as a set of moral and legal instructions, detailing the laws that govern the lifestyle and spiritual practices of the Israelites as they prepare to take possession of the land promised to their ancestors.  The opening of Deuteronomy presents Moses speaking to the Israelites as they stand at the threshold of entering Canaan after wandering in the wilderness for forty years. He recounts the journey they took, the victories against kings like Sihon and Og, and underscores the importance of obeying the commandments given by Yahweh. Moses emphasizes the need for Israel to recognize the significance of their covenant with God, urging them to follow His laws and remain faithful to Him. He also reflects on their past mistakes, particularly their rebellion, thereby reinforcing the need for trust and obedience to ensure their success in the land they are about to inherit.
