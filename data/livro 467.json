    "resumo": "\"The Stowaway\" by Alvin Heiner is a science fiction short story originally published in the early 1950s. The narrative explores themes of ambition, identity, and the quest for recognition through the lens of a working-class protagonist, Joe Spain, who seeks glory and representation by sneaking onto a rocket ship headed to the Moon. This work reflects the mid-20th century's fascination with space exploration and the socio-political dynamics of class.  The story centers around Joe Spain, a determined but overlooked worker who dreams of being part of the historic moon mission. Despite ridicule from his peers and the overwhelming security at the launch site, he concocts a plan to stow away in a barrel that will be sent aboard the rocket. With great desperation, he succeeds in gaining access and rides in the barrel during the launch. However, once aboard, he discovers the ship is experimental and doomed to explode. Alone in darkness, Joe grapples with his fate, realizing he will never be acknowledged or remembered for his daring aspirations. The story ultimately serves as a poignant commentary on the human desire for significance amidst societal indifference. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
