    "resumo": "\"Rosvot: Viisinäytöksinen näytelmä\" by Friedrich Schiller is a dramatic play written in the late 18th century. This work delves into themes of morality, human nature, and social injustice, centering around the character of Kaarle von Moor, a troubled nobleman entangled in a life of crime and familial strife. The narrative explores the complexities of virtue and vice, as it examines the dichotomy of human experience through its rich cast of characters.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to a poignant family dynamic involving Kaarle von Moor and his father, vanha Moor. The scene unfolds with the father anxiously awaiting news about Kaarle, whose actions have cast a shadow on their family name. As the exchange progresses, the two brothers, Frans and Kaarle, are portrayed in stark contrast: Frans is depicted as the dutiful son, while Kaarle embodies the rebellious figure, bringing turmoil not only to his father’s life but to the entire family. The opening sets the stage for a gripping exploration of love, betrayal, and the struggle for identity within the framework of societal expectations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
