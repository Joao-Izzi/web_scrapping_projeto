    "resumo": "\"Pictorial Beauty on the Screen\" by Victor Oscar Freeburg is a scholarly examination of cinematic artistry written in the early 20th century. This work aims to elevate the motion picture from mere entertainment to a recognized form of pictorial art, focusing on the importance of visual composition, light, and shadow in capturing beauty on film. The author argues that cinema must seek to convey emotional and aesthetic experiences akin to traditional visual arts, encouraging both audiences and creators to appreciate the artistic potential of the medium.  The opening of the book sets the stage by emphasizing the evolving expectations of the average moviegoer, who now desires more than just popcorn thrillsâ€”they are demanding true beauty in motion pictures. Freeburg critiques the industry's historical reliance on thrilling but superficial visual elements and calls for a shift towards a more thoughtful approach to composition, akin to that found in painting. He introduces the concept of the \"cinema composer,\" a director who must weave together various visual elements into a cohesive whole, capable of evoking deeper emotional responses, thereby enriching the viewer's experience. This foundational perspective invites readers to reflect on the visual language of cinema and its potential for artistic expression. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
