    "resumo": "\"In Egitto: La caccia della jena\" by Michele Lessona is a travel narrative written in the late 19th century. This book captures the author's adventures and observations during his time in Egypt, providing insights into the culture, landscapes, and the unique experiences he encounters. The text serves as both a personal memoir and a reflection on the surroundings and people he interacts with, specifically focusing on a hunting expedition for a jackal.  The story begins as the author, introduced to a French traveler named Oscar Verdier, recounts his experiences and interacts with local figures like Mohammed-effendi, who serves as Verdier's interpreter. As they engage in discussions about local customs and the history of the region, the narrative unfolds into an exploration of their planned hunting adventure. The plot progresses through detailed descriptions of their encounters, cultural exchanges, and the dynamics of their expedition, culminating in a tragic and ironic conclusion highlighting the dangers of the region, as Verdier meets an untimely death shortly after their adventure. This work offers a rich portrayal of Egyptian life, blending humor with serious observations about cultural differences and the consequences of foreign interactions.
