    "resumo": "\"Edith and John: A Story of Pittsburgh\" by Franklin S. Farquhar is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds in the industrial city of Pittsburgh, vividly capturing the lives of its characters amidst the smoky, damp backdrop of the era. Central to the plot are John Winthrope, a young man from the countryside trying to make a living in the city, and Edith Jarney, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Their lives intersect, suggesting a narrative that will explore themes of class disparity, romance, and personal ambition.  At the start of the book, readers are introduced to the gritty urban environment of Pittsburgh on a grim November evening. John Winthrope, recently relocated to the city for work, finds himself in the midst of a chaotic and rainy atmosphere as he navigates the streets home. In a serendipitous encounter, he helps Edith, whose umbrella has broken during their hurried travels, thus initiating a conversation filled with charm and unexpected chemistry between them. As they interact, both characters are revealed: John struggling with his lowly job and living conditions, and Edith, portrayed as spirited and unpretentious despite her wealth. The opening sets a tone for a tale woven with humor, compassion, and the stark realities of life in a bustling industrial city. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
