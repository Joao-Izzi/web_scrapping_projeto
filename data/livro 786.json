    "resumo": "\"Die Stadt ohne Juden: Ein Roman von übermorgen\" by Hugo Bettauer is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in Vienna, focusing on the societal consequences of a radical political shift that leads to the expulsion of the Jewish population. The narrative highlights the character of Dr. Karl Schwertfeger, the Federal Chancellor, who emerges as a figure championing anti-Semitic policies amidst a public fervor that calls for the exclusion of Jews from Austrian society.  The opening of the novel vividly captures a tense atmosphere in Vienna, where a large crowd gathers at the Parliament building for a significant political event. Tensions rise as enthusiastic supporters rally for Dr. Schwertfeger, who is set to present a law aimed at expelling all Jewish citizens. The scene is filled with both zealous demonstrations and an undercurrent of dread as the political ramifications of such an event begin to materialize. We see the crowd's mixed reactions to the anticipated speech, foreshadowing the chaos and moral dilemmas that will follow the implementation of this law, laying the groundwork for a commentary on intolerance and the consequences of societal scapegoating.
