    "resumo": "\"John Porter Fort: A Memorial, and Personal Reminiscences\" by John Porter Fort is a memoir written in the early 20th century. The text explores the life, achievements, and contributions of John Porter Fort, particularly his significant impact on the state of Georgia through agricultural innovations, notably the introduction of artesian wells which improved health conditions in the region. The memoir is presented through reminiscences dictated by Fort himself, shedding light on both personal and public aspects of his life.  At the start of the memoir, the author provides a foreword that reflects on his father's life and accomplishments. The opening portions detail John P. Fort's early influences growing up in Georgia, including the relationship with his parents, particularly his father's medical career and his mother's nurturing spirit. It then transitions into Fort's early interests in nature and his formative experiences, including his education and observations during his childhood. By sharing anecdotes about his upbringing, military service, and his determination to improve the living conditions in Georgia, the memoir sets the stage for an exploration of his later scientific contributions and entrepreneurial ventures.
