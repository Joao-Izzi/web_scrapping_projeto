    "resumo": "\"Storia della Repubblica di Firenze v. 2/3\" by Gino Capponi is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book delves into the political and social dynamics of Florence during pivotal events, such as the tumultuous period of the Ciompi in 1378. Capponi offers a detailed narrative of the struggles and triumphs faced by the populace, particularly focusing on the conflict between the major and minor guilds within the republic.  The opening of the work introduces the reader to a politically charged atmosphere in Florence, describing the growing tensions between the ruling factions and the discontented lower classes. It highlights the abuses of power by the ruling elite, particularly the Captain of the guelf faction, and sets the stage for the uprising led by the Ciompi, a group of lower artisans and workers seeking redress against oppression. The narrative follows the awakening of the plebe, their quest for equality, and the ensuing chaos as they rise against the tyranny, signaling the evolving social fabric of late medieval Florence.
