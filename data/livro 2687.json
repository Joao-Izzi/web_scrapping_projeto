    "resumo": "\"Extinct Birds\" by The Hon. Walter Rothschild is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work provides a comprehensive account of bird species that have become extinct in historical times, specifically within the last six or seven hundred years, along with some species that are currently on the verge of extinction. The book combines thorough research with visual illustrations to highlight the life and characteristics of these birds, underlining the impact of human activity on their demise.  The opening of \"Extinct Birds\" introduces the author's motivation to compile a more detailed narrative from a previously presented lecture at the Ornithological Congress in 1905. Rothschild expresses gratitude to fellow ornithologists who contributed to his research, emphasizing the challenge of documenting species based on limited physical evidence like bones and descriptions from ancient texts. He mentions the dual categories of extinct birds: those known from external features and those represented only by skeletal remains. In this initial section, the author sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the factors contributing to these species' extinctions, particularly emphasizing human influence and environmental changes.
