    "resumo": "\"Indian Summer\" by William Dean Howells is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story focuses on the character Colville, a disillusioned journalist who finds himself in Florence, grappling with the dissatisfaction of his past life in America and contemplating a fresh start away from the disappointments he has faced.  At the start of the novel, Colville is introduced as he lounges by the Ponte Vecchio, reflecting on his life choices and the bitter disappointment he experienced upon leaving his successful newspaper career in Des Vaches, Indiana. As he immerses himself in the vibrant yet familiar sights of Florence, he feels an acute sense of loss for the life he abandoned, despite having returned to pursue art and architecture. The narrative takes a turn when he encounters Mrs. Bowen, an old acquaintance, and her daughter Effie, which reignites memories of his past and opens the door to new social interactions, marking the beginning of his exploration of identity, nostalgia, and the complexities of human connections in a foreign land.
