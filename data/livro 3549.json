    "resumo": "\"Hindu Magic: An Expose of the Tricks of the Yogis and Fakirs of India\" by Carrington is a scientific publication written during the early 20th century. The book critically examines various traditional performances and tricks attributed to Indian yogis and fakirs, assessing their nature and the methods behind them. Carrington aims to demystify these acts and reveal the underlying principles of deception, rather than attributing them to supernormal abilities.  Throughout the book, Carrington systematically describes and analyzes several well-known tricks performed by Indian conjurers, such as the mango-tree trick and the basket trick. He provides detailed explanations of how these illusions are executed, often involving clever manipulation, special preparations, and the use of props that lead to the appearance of miraculous feats. The author emphasizes the psychological aspects of these performances, illustrating how audience perception and expectation can enhance the effects of the tricks. By unraveling the secrets behind these so-called magical phenomena, Carrington encourages readers to view such acts through a lens of critical inquiry rather than superstition.
