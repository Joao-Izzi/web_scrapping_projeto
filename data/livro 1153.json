    "resumo": "\"The Master Builder\" by Henrik Ibsen is a play written during the late 19th century. This work marks the final stage of Ibsen’s career, focusing on existential themes and the psyche of its characters, primarily exploring the life of Halvard Solness, a master builder who grapples with his own fears and ambitions. The narrative delves into Solness's relationships, particularly with Hilda Wangel, who enters his life unexpectedly and challenges his perceptions of success and legacy.  At the start of the play, we find Halvard Solness in a conversation with his employees, Knut Brovik and Ragnar, who are concerned about the prospects of Ragnar's career. Solness is defensive about his position and expresses fear of being overshadowed by the younger generation. Kaia, another character, reveals her affection for Solness, adding complexity to their dynamic, while Solness’s wife, Aline, complicates the picture further with hints of her own struggles and jealousy. Hilda Wangel’s arrival introduces an intriguing twist, evoking memories and feelings from Solness's past that unsettle his current life, setting the stage for the unfolding psychological drama.
