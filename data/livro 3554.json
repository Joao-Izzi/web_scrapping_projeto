    "resumo": "\"No Substitutions\" by Jim Harmon is a science fiction short story that was published in Galaxy Magazine in the late 1950s. The narrative explores a futuristic penal system where criminals are placed into an artificial Dreamland, allowing them to live out fantasies instead of serving time in a traditional prison. The story offers a commentary on the nature of reality, sanity, and human morality within a highly controlled environment.  The plot centers around Warden Walker, who oversees the Dreamland facility, as he grapples with ethical dilemmas related to the treatment of inmates. The story intensifies when Councilman Coleman, a power figure, questions Walker's perception of reality, suggesting that Walker himself might be living in a Dream. This leads to a series of interactions with various inmates who wish to return to Dreamland, each illustrating different perspectives on confinement and escapism. As Walker navigates the complexities of his role and the nature of his own reality, he must confront his beliefs about freedom, identity, and the very essence of existence. Ultimately, the story raises profound questions about the boundaries of human experience and the moral implications of a life divorced from authentic reality.
