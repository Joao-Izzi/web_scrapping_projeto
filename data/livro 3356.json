    "resumo": "\"Chantecler: Play in Four Acts\" by Edmond Rostand is a whimsical play from the early 20th century that combines elements of allegory and comedy. It centers around Chantecler, a proud rooster who believes his crowing brings the sun to rise and maintains the order of the farmyard. Through a rich ensemble cast of barnyard animals, including hens, a blackbird, a turkey, and even a pheasant-hen, the play explores themes of vanity, self-importance, and the interplay between nature and society.  The opening of the play establishes a vibrant farmyard setting where various birds and animals chatter, showcasing their personalities and relationships. We are introduced to Chantecler, who is depicted as theatrical and self-absorbed, lavishing praise on the sun, which he reveres as a goddess. Other characters, like the skeptical blackbird and loyal dog Patou, provide contrasting views about Chanteclerâ€™s lofty self-image. In this lively atmosphere, the characters engage in banter that hints at societal critiques, such as the impact of new fashions and ideas. The initial interactions establish a comedic tone while foreshadowing the potential conflicts that may arise as the story unfolds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
