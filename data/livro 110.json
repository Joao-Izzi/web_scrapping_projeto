    "resumo": "\"The Spark (The 'Sixties)\" by Edith Wharton is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set against the backdrop of New York society, the narrative explores themes of personal identity, social constraints, and the impact of the past on the present. The story revolves around the complex relationships among its characters, particularly focusing on Hayley Delane, a middle-aged banker whose life is intertwined with the vibrant yet superficial world of the upper class.  The plot centers on Hayley Delane, who appears to lead a life of quiet complacency within the confines of his affluent social circle. The narrative unfolds through the observations of a young man who admires Delane's stoic demeanor and puzzling motivations. As tensions arise surrounding Delane's relationship with his wife, Leila, and his father-in-law, Bill Gracy, the story examines the underlying currents of cruelty, vulnerability, and the struggle for authenticity. Through his interactions, Delane's character reveals deeper emotional truths, highlighting the dichotomy between societal expectations and individual desires. Ultimately, \"The Spark\" offers a poignant commentary on the complexities of human connections and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
