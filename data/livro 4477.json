    "resumo": "\"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Part 20\" by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is a novel written in the early 17th century during the Spanish Golden Age. This literary work centers around the adventures of an aging nobleman, Don Quixote, who becomes enamored with the ideals of chivalry and sets out on a series of ridiculous quests accompanied by his loyal squire, Sancho Panza. The duality of their characters—Quixote's lofty ideals contrasted with Sancho's practical wisdom—serves as a critical exploration of the themes of reality versus illusion.  In this part of the story, Don Quixote's resolve to return to knight-errantry is met with resistance from his niece and housekeeper, who fear for his safety. Despite their insistence on the perils of his adventures, Quixote remains steadfast in his belief that true valor lies in pursuing noble causes, even when it leads him into folly. Meanwhile, Sancho Panza, who initially hesitates, ultimately agrees to accompany him once more. The narrative is marked by a mix of humor, philosophical inquiry, and poignant moments as they encounter various characters, including the bachelor Samson Carrasco, all while preparing for a new journey. This chapter continues to build on the rich tapestry of Quixote's quests, showcasing the clash between his grand ideals and the mundane truths of life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
