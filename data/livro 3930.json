    "resumo": "\"On the Vice of Novel Reading\" by Young Ewing Allison is a critical essay written in the late 19th century. The author presents an impassioned defense of novel reading against the pervasive societal belief that it constitutes a moral vice. The book examines the arguments against novels and explores their significance in conveying human thought and experience.  In this work, Allison argues that novel reading has often been dismissed as frivolous and dangerous, likening it to other vices such as gambling and drinking. He challenges this perspective, asserting that novels provide profound insights into human nature, society, and history. Through various examples, he illustrates how novels can educate readers, inspire empathy, and foster a deeper understanding of the complexities of life. By celebrating the novel's unique ability to blend history, drama, and poetry, Allison positions it as a vital form of intellectual engagement rather than a mere source of amusement.
