    "resumo": "\"Lääkärin kohtalo: eli Sairaalan n:o 6\" by Anton Pavlovich Chekhov is a novella written during the late 19th century. The narrative focuses on the lives of patients in a mental asylum, particularly highlighting characters such as Ivan Dmitritsh Gromow, who struggles with mental illness stemming from societal pressures and personal tragedy, and other distinct individuals in the ward. Through this exploration, the novella delves into themes of sanity, societal indifference, and the bureaucratic nature of healthcare.  At the start of this work, the setting unfolds in a dilapidated separate building of a hospital surrounded by an overgrown landscape, introducing us to a grim environment that reflects the despair and neglect found within. The opening describes the lives of several patients, including the melancholic Ivan Dmitritsh, who is plagued by dark thoughts and paranoia, and Mooses, a joyful but mentally unstable man who finds a peculiar sense of freedom despite his circumstances. As we meet these characters, Chekhov sets a profound tone, illustrating their daily existence within the hospital as well as their interactions, foreshadowing deeper reflections on their condition and the societal constructs surrounding mental health.
