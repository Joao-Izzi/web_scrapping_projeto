    "resumo": "\"The House on Henry Street\" by Lillian D. Wald is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book chronicles the establishment and experiences of the Henry Street Settlement in New York City, focusing on social reform, healthcare, and the improvement of living conditions for impoverished communities. Lillian D. Wald serves as a central figure, sharing her journey and commitment to addressing social issues, especially those affecting women and children.  The opening of the book introduces Wald's initial encounters with the grim realities of life on the East Side of New York City. Following her training as a nurse, she is drawn to the sick and impoverished families residing in tenements, awakening her social conscience. She describes her experiences alongside a little girl who leads her to a desperate family's home, highlighting the overwhelming conditions they face. This experience galvanizes Wald and her colleague Mary Brewster to not only provide nursing care but to immerse themselves in the community life, laying the groundwork for the broader activities of the Henry Street Settlement aimed at systemic reform and community support.
