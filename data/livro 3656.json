    "resumo": "\"Hodge and His Masters\" by Richard Jefferies is a collection of essays written during the late 19th century, reflecting on agricultural life and the various characters inhabiting the rural landscape. The work delves into the complexities and struggles faced by farmers and laborers, examining the social and economic dynamics of their lives, particularly during a time of agricultural depression. Jefferies presents a range of characters, such as farmers, their tenants, and laborers, encapsulating their individual experiences and the impact of their choices on their livelihoods.  At the start of the book, the scene is set in a small rural town, emphasizing the bustling activities typical of a market day. The narrative opens with a vivid description of the Jason Inn, a central location where farmers gather amidst the noise and chaos of selling and trading. As they settle down to discuss a pressing lecture titled \"Science, the Remedy for Agricultural Depression,\" the professor passionately argues that the agricultural community is to blame for their misfortunes due to their reluctance to embrace modern farming methods. This sparks a vibrant debate among the farmers about the realities of agriculture, the influence of tradition, and the dire need for reform, illustrating the tension between progress and conservatism entrenched in rural life. The opening portion effectively captures the reader's attention with its rich characterizations and social commentary, setting the tone for the themes explored throughout the text.
