    "resumo": "\"The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition, Vol. 22\" by Stevenson is a collection of essays and historical reflections written in the late 19th century. This volume focuses on particular events in Scottish history, particularly the Pentland Rising of 1666, which signifies a revolt against oppressive governance. It explores themes of persecution, rebellion, and the human spirit in the context of Scotland's past, presenting both narrative and analytical elements.  At the start of this volume, the author discusses the causes of the Pentland Rising, detailing the oppressive circumstances faced by Nonconformists in Scotland, particularly regarding the harsh penalties for absenteeism from state-sanctioned church services. Stevenson vividly depicts the dire situation of individuals like John Neilson, whose hardships are emblematic of the broader suffering experienced by many at the time. The tension escalates with a specific incident where soldiers mistreat an elderly man, igniting the rebellion led by local figures like Captain Andrew Gray. This opening portion sets a dramatic tone, revealing both the historical facts and the emotional weight behind them, hinting at the subsequent developments of the uprising that would be explored in later chapters.
