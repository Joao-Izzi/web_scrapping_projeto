    "resumo": "\"The Banished: A Swabian Historical Tale\" by Wilhelm Hauff is a historical novel written in the early 19th century. The story is set against the political backdrop of 16th century Southern Germany, focusing on Duke Ulerich of Würtemberg and the tumultuous events that unfold as he faces opposition from the Swabian League. The novel explores themes of love, honor, and the struggles of the nobility during a time of conflict, with the main characters including Duke Ulerich, his noble opponents, and two young women of interest, Bertha and Marie.  At the start of the narrative, tension fills the air in the imperial town of Ulm on March 12, 1519, as the citizens gather for a notable procession marking the arrival of the Swabian League’s forces. We are introduced to two young maidens, Bertha and her cousin Marie, who watch the procession unfold from a window. Their observations reveal the political stakes involved, while the imminent conflict adds a layer of urgency to their personal lives. The beginning sets the stage for romantic intrigue as Bertha's reserved demeanor contrasts with Marie's vivacious nature, hinting at deeper emotional tensions, especially regarding Bertha's secret attachment to a young warrior named Albert von Sturmfeder. As political alliances shift, the story promises to entwine themes of personal passions with the greater turmoil of war. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
