Rákosi expresses his intention to clarify and defend his concept of tragedy against criticisms, establishing a foundation for his philosophical exploration. He critiques both philosophical thought and established aesthetic principles, arguing that the essence of tragedy lies in the intricate relationship between moral failures and their repercussions, while emphasizing the importance of personal and societal ethics in understanding tragic narratives.
