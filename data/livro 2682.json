The book documents the contributions and experiences of the Craven Territorials, specifically the 6th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment, during World War I. The focus is on the local soldiers from Craven who engaged in the conflict and the sacrifices they made for their country.  The opening of the text establishes the purpose of the work as a tribute to those from the Craven area who served in the Great War. It outlines the noble intentions of the author and contributors to commemorate their courage and resilience in battle. The narrative begins on the eve of the war, highlighting the community's response to the mobilization orders and quickly transitions into the early days of training, setting the stage for their subsequent engagements and heroism on the battlefields.
