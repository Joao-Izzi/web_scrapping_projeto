    "resumo": "\"Pharisaism, Its Aim and Its Method\" by R. Travers Herford is a scholarly publication written in the early 20th century. This work aims to explore the religious philosophy of the Pharisees, providing a sympathetic perspective that seeks to clarify their beliefs and practices rather than portray them solely as antagonistic to early Christianity. The author emphasizes the continued relevance of Pharisaism in shaping Judaism as a living faith through the ages.  The opening of the book begins with a preface outlining Herford's intent to present the Pharisaic understanding of religion from their own viewpoint, moving away from typical Christian interpretations. He emphasizes the importance of comprehending the Pharisees as individuals with genuine spiritual pursuits rather than simply categorizing them as hypocrites. The text launches into a historical sketch that traces the development of Pharisaism from its roots in Ezra to its significant impact on Judaism and the evolution of religious practices, particularly through the study of Torah and the establishment of the synagogue. Through this framework, Herford prepares to delve deeper into the principles and theology of Pharisaism, indicating that this understanding is crucial for effectively interpreting the New Testamentâ€™s stance on the Pharisees.
