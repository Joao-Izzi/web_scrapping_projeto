    "resumo": "\"For the Defence\" by Fergus Hume is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around retired Major Laurence Jen, who has adopted two boys, Maurice and David, and their complicated lives, particularly revolving around their affections for the same woman, Isabella Dallas. As the plot unfolds, tensions arise between the young men due to their competing desires for Isabella, set against a backdrop of superstition and colonial influences from characters like the ominous Dr. Etwald and the enigmatic Dido.  The opening of the novel introduces us to the Major's household and hints at underlying tensions. Major Jen's background as a soldier influences the dynamics at his estate, Ashantee, where he has raised the boys with affection and care. However, the peace of their lives is disrupted when both young men declare their love for Isabella, leading to jealousy and conflict. Simultaneously, the presence of the mysterious Dr. Etwald foreshadows darker elements in the narrative, notably regarding palmistry and life-and-death prophecies. Additionally, the introduction of Dido, a woman steeped in the local superstitions of her West Indian heritage, raises questions about the intersection of love, power, and fate, hinting at further complications to come as the characters navigate their intertwined fates.
