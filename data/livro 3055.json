    "resumo": "\"Le diable boiteux, tome I\" by Alain René Le Sage is a novel written in the early 18th century. It follows the adventures of Don Cléofas, a student who encounters a mischievous and whimsical character, the demon Asmodée, also known as the \"boiteux\" (lame devil). The book likely explores themes of satire, human foibles, and societal norms through a mix of humor and supernatural elements.  At the start of the story, Don Cléofas narrowly escapes from a perilous situation where he is being pursued by spadassins after a romantic encounter. In his flight, he accidentally stumbles upon a hidden attic where he releases Asmodée, the demon imprisoned in a bottle by an astrologer. Asmodée, eager to assist Cléofas in his affairs and reveal the secrets of the world, takes him on a fantastical journey that promises to unveil the machinations of human behavior and society in Madrid. The opening portions set the stage for playful mischief, clever dialogue, and the intertwining of the mortal and supernatural worlds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
