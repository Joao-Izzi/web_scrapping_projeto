    "resumo": "\"The Time of Roses\" by L. T. Meade is a novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Florence Aylmer, a young woman adjusting to life after school, and her interactions with her unconventional mother, Mrs. Aylmer, and an old acquaintance, Bertha Keys. As the characters grapple with independence, familial expectations, and powerful acquaintances, readers are drawn into a narrative filled with both personal and societal challenges.  At the start of the book, we meet Mrs. Aylmer, who anxiously awaits the return of her daughter Florence and her friend Kitty Sharston. The novel sets the stage in a quaint cottage at Dawlish, revealing the dynamics between the characters as they navigate their new lives after school. Tension arises with the return of Bertha, who previously harmed Florence's standing in society. As Bertha insinuates herself into Florence's current life, the reader senses an impending conflict, particularly around themes of loyalty and integrity, as Florence wrestles with the decision of whether to accept Berthaâ€™s tempting offer of financial assistance, which could potentially entangle her in a web of moral ambiguity. The opening chapters hint at a rich exploration of relationships and character development, setting a compelling tone for the rest of the story. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
