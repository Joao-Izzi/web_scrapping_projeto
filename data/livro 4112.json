    "resumo": "\"The Mouthpiece of Zitu\" by J. U. Giesy is a science fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the character Dr. Murray, the medical director of a state hospital for the insane, who encounters a mysterious patient named Jason Croft. This patient claims to be the reincarnation of Croft, who once departed to another planet, Palos, and now seeks Murrayâ€™s help to navigate his new existence and the responsibilities awaiting him there.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Dr. Murray as he examines a new patient showing signs of dissociation from his identity. As Murray delves into the man's physical condition, he discovers that the man is not just any patient; he claims to be Jason Croft, whom Murray thought had died. Croft explains that he has been reincarnated in this new body and has come back seeking knowledge to aid his people on Palos. The opening sets a tone of intrigue and introduces themes of identity, the supernatural, and interstellar existence, inviting readers to ponder the boundaries of reality as they follow Croft's journey.
