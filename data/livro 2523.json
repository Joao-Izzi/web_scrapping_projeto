    "resumo": "\"Don Orsino\" by F. Marion Crawford is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story centers on Don Orsino Saracinesca, a young man navigating the complexities of life in modern Rome, against a backdrop of social and political upheaval following Italy's unification. This semantic richness is complemented by themes of family, duty, and the clash between tradition and the emerging modernity of society.  The opening of the novel introduces the Saracinesca family and the historical context in which they exist, touching on the legacy of the family's past and the significant changes that have affected Rome and its society. We learn about Orsino's upbringing under the watchful eyes of his parents, Giovanni and Corona, and the weight of expectations that come with being part of this noble lineage. As Orsino approaches adulthood, he grapples with the limitations of his privileged life, the lack of a defined path, and the intrigue introduced by a captivating woman, Madame d'Aragona, with whom he shares an initial connection. The portrayal of the relationships and shifting societal norms sets the stage for Orsino's journey, hinting at both personal growth and the exploration of love in a changing world.
