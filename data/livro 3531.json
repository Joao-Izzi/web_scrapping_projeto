    "resumo": "\"The Indian Bangle\" by Fergus Hume is a mystery novel written in the late 19th century. The story intertwines the themes of romance and intrigue, revolving around the characters of Olive Bellairs, who is caught in an arranged marriage with Angus Carson, and Laurence Mallow, a journalist with unrequited feelings for Olive. The narrative is steeped in mystery, particularly surrounding a murder case that seems to have connections to the characters' lives.  The opening of the work introduces readers to the unfolding drama beginning with Mrs. Purcell's letter, which announces her husband's death and her intentions to return to England while contemplating her daughter Olive's future. It details Olive's arranged engagement to Angus Carson, a man she has never met, which is tied to a sizable inheritance and her father's dying wish. As the characters grapple with these arrangements, a separate narrative thread emerges concerning a gruesome murder, hinting at ties to Angus Carson and raising questions of identity and fate. The scene is set for both romantic entanglement and the dark intrigue surrounding the murder mystery that will likely intertwine further as the story progresses.
