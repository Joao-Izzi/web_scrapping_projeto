    "resumo": "\"Literary Blunders: A Chapter in the 'History of Human Error'\" by Henry B. Wheatley is a historical account likely written in the late 19th century. The book explores the various types of blunders made in literature, examining the effects of errors in writing and translation, as well as the unique character of common misunderstandings in language. Wheatley aims to shed light on the amusing and sometimes serious consequences of these mistakes while celebrating the quirks of literary history.  The opening of the work serves as a preface, setting the stage for the discussion of literary blunders by referencing Augustine Caxton's unrealized \"History of Human Error.\" Wheatley introduces the concept of blunders versus mistakes, suggesting that blunders often originate from mental confusion and can be light-hearted despite their serious origins. The author indicates that the subsequent chapters will cover various examples, including ghost words, misprints, errata, and the unintentional twists of language that give birth to mistakenly attributed literary tales. This engaging introduction promises a blend of humor and academic analysis, inviting readers to explore the rich tapestry of human oversight in the literary world.
