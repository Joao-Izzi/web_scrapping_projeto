    "resumo": "\"Twenty-four Discourses\" by Nathan Perkins is a collection of sermons likely delivered to a Congregational church in Hartford, Connecticut, around the late 18th century. This work aims to elucidate important truths, duties, and institutions of Christianity, with a particular emphasis on the significance of the New Testament ordinances such as baptism and the Lord's Supper. The author seeks to address the beliefs and practices of Christians, encouraging personal conviction and adherence to the tenets of faith.  The opening of the discourses begins with a dedication to Perkins' congregation, emphasizing his commitment to their spiritual education and the defense of the core principles of Christianity. He outlines the importance of understanding the common state of humanityâ€”what it means to be \"without Christ\" and the overwhelming spiritual need for divine grace and revelation for salvation. This portion lays a foundational understanding of Perkins' approach, which posits that reason alone is insufficient for achieving a true understanding of God and morality, setting the stage for the forthcoming discussions on various theological topics.
