    "resumo": "\"A Manual of Mending and Repairing; With Diagrams\" by Charles Godfrey Leland is a practical guide on the art of repairing various household items, written in the late 19th century. The book emphasizes that mending is not merely an adjunct to other crafts but is itself an art grounded in scientific principles and chemistry. It tackles a broad range of topics related to mending, from broken china and glass to woodwork and leather, highlighting the importance of skilled repair in everyday life.  The opening of the manual establishes the author's assertion that mending should be recognized as a significant craft, detailing how previous literature has inadequately addressed the subject. Leland introduces the foundational materials and methods necessary for effective mending, underscoring the importance of understanding various adhesives and cements. He also discusses the everyday breakages that occur in households and suggests that anyone willing to learn can become skilled in mending and restoring various objects, ultimately proposing that this knowledge can lead to making a practical living. Overall, the manual positions itself as a valuable resource for those interested in sustainable practices and the lost art of mending. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
