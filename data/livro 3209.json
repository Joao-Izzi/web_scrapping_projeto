    "resumo": "\"Life and Times of Washington, Volume 2\" by John F. Schroeder and Benson John Lossing is a historical account written in the late 19th century that delves into the life of George Washington, particularly focusing on his military leadership during the American Revolution. This volume covers significant events from 1775 to the conclusion of the war, highlighting Washington's strategies, challenges, and decisions as he guides the Continental Army against British forces.   The opening of the book presents Washington dealing with the complexities of wartime leadership, particularly around the inhumane treatment of American prisoners by the British. It describes Washington's frustration with the British dismissing American prisoners as rebels, not deserving the courtesy typically extended in warfare. Key events such as the capture of General Lee, retaliatory actions taken by Congress, and Washington's push for humane treatment of prisoners unfold. Additionally, the text hints at forthcoming military strategies, highlighting Washington's plans to inoculate the army against smallpox, as well as his foresight in anticipating the enemy's movements, setting the stage for his later encounters against formidable British troops. This detailed historical narrative provides valuable insights into the trials faced by Washington and the nascent nation during a tumultuous period. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
