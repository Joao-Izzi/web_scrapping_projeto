    "resumo": "\"Essay on the Principles of Translation\" by Lord Alexander Fraser Tytler Woodhouselee is a critical work on literary translation written in the late 18th century. This essay aims to discuss and elucidate the principles and rules governing the art of translation, addressing both the difficulties involved and the standards for achieving a faithful yet stylistically appropriate rendition of texts.   The opening of the essay sets the stage for this discussion by highlighting the historical lack of formal analysis in literary translation, despite its acknowledged importance. Tytler reflects on how even ancient authors recognized the value of translation but failed to establish guiding principles for it. He proposes to fill this gap in understanding by exploring what constitutes a good translation and outlining general rules based on this definition. This includes examining how translators should balance fidelity to the original text with the need for eloquence in the target language, emphasizing the complexities involved in achieving an accurate and effective translation while engaging with various examples from literary history.
