    "resumo": "\"More Beetles\" by Jean-Henri Fabre is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work is part of Fabre's larger entomological corpus, focusing specifically on various species of beetles and their natural behaviors, life cycles, and habitats. In it, Fabre reflects not only on the intricate lives of these insects but also on his observations and interactions with them, offering readers a glimpse into the world of entomology.  The opening of \"More Beetles\" introduces us to the author's personal reflections during a late spring day amidst lilac blossoms, where he admires the array of insects, particularly the Cetonia, or rose beetle. He describes the vibrant scene of diverse bugs engaging in their natural rituals and highlights the innocence of childhood as his young daughter enjoys catching the beetles, while he contemplates the ethical implications of experimenting on them in pursuit of knowledge. This dual perspective of both a naturalist observing and a father sharing in the joys of nature establishes a thematic exploration of curiosity, discovery, and the sometimes harsh realities of the natural world. The text sets the stage for a detailed study of the behaviours and characteristics of beetles, blending scientific inquiry with poetic imagery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
