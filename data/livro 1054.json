    "resumo": "\"J. S. Le Fanu's Ghostly Tales, Volume 3\" by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu is a collection of ghost stories likely written in the late 19th century. This volume, opening with \"The Haunted Baronet,\" sets the stage in the picturesque village of Golden Friars, shrouded in mystery and supernatural occurrences, particularly revolving around the troubled lives of local inhabitants and the secrets they harbor.  The opening portion introduces readers to the charming yet eerie setting of Golden Friars, primarily featuring the George and Dragon inn, where a group of local patrons discusses the impending return of Sir Bale Mardykes, a man linked to a tragic past involving a drowned woman and her child. The narratives unravel the intertwining fates of Sir Bale, Philip Feltram—an illegitimate descendant of a lost noble lineage—and unsettling tales of ghostly apparitions connected to the lake nearby. As the story progresses, feelings of dread and foreboding linger, setting in motion a series of events that will clash with the ghostly past that haunts both the characters and the landscape, hinting toward themes of guilt, retribution, and the supernatural's infiltration into daily life.
