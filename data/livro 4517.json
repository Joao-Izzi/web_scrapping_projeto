    "resumo": "\"The Third Degree: A Narrative of Metropolitan Life\" by Charles Klein and Arthur Hornblow is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is centered around Howard Jeffries, a young man grappling with his failures in life, particularly his struggle with alcoholism and the repercussions of marrying a woman from a lower social class. The narrative delves into themes of ambition, social status, and personal redemption against the backdrop of bustling urban life in New York City.  The opening of the novel presents Howard Jeffries at a low point, lost in the midday rush of the city, reflecting on his dismal state as he searches for work. Once a promising graduate with a bright future, Howard is now a failure in his own eyes, burdened by his past mistakes and the fallout from his marriage to Annie, a waitress. As he confronts feelings of shame, disappointment, and envy towards the industrious crowds around him, the reader learns about his estrangement from his wealthy family and the challenges of providing for his wife. His interactions with other characters, including old classmates and acquaintances, hint at the complications of his life choices and set the stage for the unfolding drama of personal and social conflicts.
