    "resumo": "\"A Valiant Ignorance\" by Mary Angela Dickens is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Hermia Romayne, a seemingly self-possessed woman whose life is abruptly altered by the suicide of her husband, William Romayne, following his exposure as a swindler. As the narrative unfolds, it delves into Hermia's reaction to her husband's disgrace, her complex emotional landscape, and the societal implications of her circumstances.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the table d’hôte room of a hotel in Nice, where Mrs. Romayne is dining alone. We see her as a woman of the world, effortlessly navigating social mores while occasionally glancing at the letters she has received, which reveal her personal life and connections. The tension escalates when it is revealed that her husband has committed suicide, leaving her to confront the fallout of his actions and the resulting social stigma. The characters that inhabit her world—ranging from fellow hotel guests to acquaintances who are indifferent to her plight—paint a vivid picture of the societal pressures facing women of her standing, setting the stage for the unfolding drama of betrayal, scandal, and resilience.
