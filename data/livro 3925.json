    "resumo": "\"Synthetic Tannins, Their Synthesis, Industrial Production and Application\" by Georg Crasser is a scientific publication likely written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the burgeoning field of synthetic tannins, their chemical synthesis, practical applications in leather production, and their significance in the chemical industry post-World War I. The book aims to summarize the advancements made in synthesizing tannins, which are critical for the modern leather industry, and highlights the substantial economic benefits of utilizing domestic products over reliance on imported materials.  At the start of the book, the author introduces the concept of tannins, emphasizing their role in transforming animal hides into leather through complex chemical interactions. He discusses the foundational work of Emil Fischer on natural tannins and the later movement toward synthetic alternatives, initiated by the Badische Anilin und Soda-fabrik. Crasser emphasizes the practical implications of his research, underscoring the universality and essential nature of synthetic tannins within the leather industry. He also provides insight into his professional background that informed his analysis, illustrating his firsthand experience in applying synthetic tanning methods during his tenure as a technical consultant to the Austrian Hide and Leather Commission.
