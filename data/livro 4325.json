    "resumo": "\"By the Light of the Soul: A Novel\" by Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Maria Edgham, a sensitive and introspective young girl, as she navigates the complexities of her family’s life, particularly dealing with her mother’s illness and her father's potential remarriage. The narrative delves into themes of childhood innocence, familial bonds, and the emotional turmoil arising from loss and change.  The opening of the novel introduces Maria sitting in a church vestry during a prayer meeting, where she is preoccupied with her thoughts about the people around her, including a grieving mother and a young man she admires. As the prayer meeting unfolds, Maria's innocence is palpable; she is caught between the world of childhood fantasies and the harsh realities of adult life, particularly her mother's illness and the implications of her father's emerging relationship with a local schoolteacher, Miss Slome. As the narrative progresses, we glimpse Maria's internal struggles with her identity, her longing for acceptance, and her troubled reflections on her family's dynamics during a profound period of transition. The opening effectively sets the stage for the emotional challenges Maria will face as the story unfolds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
