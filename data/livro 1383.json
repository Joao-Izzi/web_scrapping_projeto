    "resumo": "\"Memoirs of Major Alexander Ramkins\" by Daniel Defoe is a historical account written during the early 18th century. The book follows Major Alexander Ramkins, a Highland officer, as he recounts his remarkable adventures and observations during nearly three decades of military service across various regions including Scotland, Germany, Italy, Flanders, and Ireland. Throughout these memoirs, readers are likely to encounter themes of loyalty, the complexities of political machinations, and personal amorous entanglements amid the backdrop of war and intrigue.  At the start of the memoirs, Major Ramkins reflects on his youth, recalling his initial involvement in the Battle of Gillycranky and his subsequent journey into the military life that would shape his destiny. He describes his initiation under the mentorship of an older officer who imparts valuable lessons on both military strategy and the treacherous nature of political alliances. This sets the stage for his exploration of various military campaigns and the cultivation of his thoughts on the motivations and actions of greater powers, particularly concerning the failed attempts of King James II to reclaim the throne through support from France, while also hinting at personal conflicts, including familial duties and romantic pursuits. Thus, the opening portion establishes both a personal and historical perspective that provides a rich lens through which to understand the broader implications of war and loyalty.
