    "resumo": "\"The History of Education\" by Ellwood Patterson Cubberley is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work explores the evolution of educational practices and progress as a vital aspect of Western civilization's development. The book emphasizes the historical interplay of various influences that shaped educational institutions and systems, particularly focusing on significant periods such as classical antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modern times.  The opening of the text provides insight into the author's motivations for writing, originating from his experiences as a professor of education at Stanford University. Cubberley reflects on the necessity of teaching the history of education as a means of understanding the larger narrative of societal progress. He outlines that the book will explore the contributions of ancient civilizations—particularly the Greeks, Romans, and Christians—while emphasizing the practical aspects of educational practice rather than educational theory alone. The introduction sets the tone for a detailed study that promises to examine how education has evolved across different eras, substantially impacting individual and societal growth.
