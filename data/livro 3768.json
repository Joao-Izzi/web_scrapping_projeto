    "resumo": "\"Stories from Dickens\" by J. Walker McSpadden is a collection of abridged tales based on the works of Charles Dickens, compiled in the early 20th century. This anthology focuses on the prominent characters and narratives from Dickens' novels, specifically tailored for younger readers, extracting themes of adventure, sorrow, and triumph while retaining the spirit of the original texts. The stories include beloved characters like Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, and Little Nell, making them accessible to new audiences or those intimidated by the full-length novels.  The opening of the anthology begins with a preface emphasizing the compiler’s aim of introducing young readers to the world of Dickens without overwhelming them with the complexity and length of his original works. It discusses how Dickens' stories often depict the joys and struggles of youth, highlighting key moments such as Oliver Twist’s challenging upbringing in a workhouse, where he famously asks for more food—a pivotal scene that encapsulates his desperate plight. The passage provides a glimpse into the harsh realities faced by children within Dickens’ narratives while hinting at the underlying themes of perseverance and hope that are characteristic of his work.
