The imagery is rich and often features elements such as nature—seasons, landscapes, and celestial bodies—against which the profound feelings of love and loss are set. The speaker reflects on the beauty of love while simultaneously expressing the pain of separation, nostalgia, and the inevitability of time and mortality.
