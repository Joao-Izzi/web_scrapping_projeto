    "resumo": "\"Les liaisons dangereuses, volume 1\" by Choderlos de Laclos is a novel written in the late 18th century. This provocative work is centered around themes of seduction, manipulation, and the complex social dynamics of an aristocratic milieu. The story unfolds through correspondence between characters, particularly focusing on the scheming Marquise de Merteuil and the seductive Vicomte de Valmont, who engage in a battle of wits to manipulate others for their entertainment and moral lessons.  The opening of the novel introduces readers to the initial letters exchanged by Cécile Volanges, a naïve young woman recently released from a convent, and her friend Sophie. Cécile writes about her new life filled with societal expectations and her impending arranged marriage. Simultaneously, we see the Marquise de Merteuil's cunning plans as she seeks to use Valmont to seduce Cécile as part of her broader schemes. This setup establishes a world rife with deceit and power plays, hinting at the intrigues and moral ambiguities that will develop as the characters' lives become intertwined in unexpected and often dangerous ways.
