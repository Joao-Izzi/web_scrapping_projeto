    "resumo": "\"The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit\" by Beatrix Potter is a children's picture book written in the early 20th century. The book introduces readers to the themes of good versus bad behavior through the tale of a mischievous rabbit. It captures the innocence of childhood while imparting a lesson about the consequences of one's actions.  In this story, the titular \"fierce bad rabbit\" is characterized by its aggressive behavior, such as scratching a gentle rabbit and stealing its food without asking politely. This contrasts with the kindly rabbit which shows a more passive demeanor. The narrative takes a dramatic turn when a man with a gun mistakes the bad rabbit for something else and ultimately leads to a twist of fate where the bad rabbit is left without its tail or whiskers. Through simple, engaging illustrations and a straightforward storyline, Potter delivers moral lessons about kindness and the repercussions of treachery.
