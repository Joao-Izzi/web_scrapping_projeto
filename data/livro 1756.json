    "resumo": "\"A Sermon Preached on the Anniversary of the Boston Female Asylum for Destitute Orphans\" by Jonathan M. Wainwright, D.D. is a historical sermon published in the early 19th century. This book falls under the category of religious discourse, focusing specifically on themes of charity and moral duty towards the less fortunate, particularly orphans. The sermon emphasizes not only the importance of beneficence but also the spiritual rewards that accompany acts of kindness towards those in distress.  In this sermon, Wainwright explores the moral and theological implications of aiding orphans, highlighting the deep sense of duty that Christians have to care for the needy, as expressed in the biblical proverb cited in the text: “He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed.” He advocates for a charitable mindset characterized by active compassion, urging his audience to seek out those in need rather than waiting for them to ask for assistance. By focusing on the plight of orphans and the moral imperative to support such institutions, Wainwright calls on his listeners to remember their humanity and the blessings that come from helping others. The sermon is both a heartfelt plea for action and a reminder of the spiritual significance of charity in a Christian life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
