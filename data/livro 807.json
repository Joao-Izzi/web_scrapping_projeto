    "resumo": "\"The Prophecies of the Brahan Seer (Coinneach Odhar Fiosaiche)\" by Alexander Mackenzie is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work chronicles the remarkable predictions of the Brahan Seer, Coinneach Odhar, a Highland prophet who claimed to possess the gift of prophecy and second sight. Through a detailed collection of his prophecies, the book explores themes of superstition and the rich folklore of Scottish culture, introducing readers to the mystical landscape of Highland beliefs.  At the start of the text, the author provides a preface that establishes both the historical significance of the Brahan Seer and the intrigue surrounding his prophecies. The opening portion introduces Kenneth Mackenzie, who is famously associated with these predictions, recounting various legends about how he acquired the gift of foresight, often through encounters with supernatural beings. The narrative sets the stage for a plethora of prophecies attributed to him, some of which are regarded as fulfilled, unfulfilled, or uncertain, thereby inviting readers into a captivating discourse on fate, nature, and human experience in the Scottish Highlands.
