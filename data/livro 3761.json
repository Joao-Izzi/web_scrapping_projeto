    "resumo": "\"Vapaudesta\" by John Stuart Mill is a philosophical treatise written in the late 19th century. The book explores the concept of individual liberty in relation to societal power, arguing against the tyranny of the majority and emphasizing the need for personal freedoms. Mill examines how personal freedom can coexist with societal authority and the importance of protecting individuals from both governmental oppression and social conformity.  The opening of the text introduces Mill's intentions, clarifying that he will discuss the nature and limits of societal power over individuals rather than the concept of free will. He highlights the historical struggle for liberty, emphasizing that, in modern times, the fight for individual freedoms has taken on new meanings and implications. Mill critiques the idea that society can impose its opinions on individuals, arguing that true individual freedom is essential for human flourishing and social progress. He hints at the tensions between personal liberty and societal norms, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of these themes throughout the work. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
