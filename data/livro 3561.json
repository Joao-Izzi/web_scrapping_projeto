    "resumo": "\"Lectures on the English Poets; Delivered at the Surrey Institution\" by William Hazlitt is a collection of critical lectures focused on English poetry, likely written in the early 19th century. The work serves as an exploration of the nature of poetry, its emotional resonance, and its various manifestations through notable poets from Chaucer to contemporary writers of Hazlitt's time. Through its series of lectures, the author delves into the profound impact of poetry on human experience, creating a dialogue that seeks to elevate the genre beyond mere amusement.  The beginning of this work introduces the notion of poetry as an intrinsic expression of human emotions and the imagination. Hazlitt emphasizes that poetry reflects the profound connections people have with nature and their inner lives, transcending rigid forms and conventions. He argues that all feelings—whether love, despair, or admiration—are poetic in nature, illustrating his claims by referencing historical and literary figures. He sets the stage for an in-depth analysis of individual poets and their works, presenting his foundational ideas regarding the essence of poetry, which resonates with the experiences of all people and, by extension, all poets.
