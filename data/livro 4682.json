    "resumo": "\"Little Foxes: Stories for Boys and Girls\" by E. A. Henry is a collection of inspirational stories written in the early 20th century. Aimed primarily at children, this work consists of short sermons and talks designed to impart moral lessons about character and personal conduct. Through these stories, Henry seeks to educate young readers on the significance of small actions and choices in shaping one's character.  At the start of the collection, the author introduces the metaphor of \"little foxes\" that spoil the vines, illustrating how small negative habits and attitudes can lead to larger problems in life. He discusses the importance of recognizing and addressing these \"little foxes,\" emphasizing the idea that seemingly insignificant actions—like neglecting responsibilities or adopting an indifferent attitude—can accumulate to create undesirable character traits. Through relatable examples and vivid storytelling, Henry endeavors to engage children, prompting them to understand their influence on themselves and the world around them.
