    "resumo": "\"The Young Sharpshooter at Antietam\" by Everett T. Tomlinson is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set during the American Civil War, the story follows two young Union soldiers, Noel Curtis and Dennis O'Hara, who are sharpshooters stationed at Harper's Ferry. The novel explores themes of bravery, friendship, and the harsh realities of war against the backdrop of the significant battle of Antietam.  The beginning of the story introduces readers to the lively interactions between Noel and Dennis as they embark on a foraging expedition, full of humor and camaraderie. Dennis is portrayed as a jovial Irishman whose antics, including an encounter with a large negress and a search for fresh food, set a lighthearted tone before the weight of war becomes apparent. However, as they wander away from camp, they encounter Confederate soldiers, leading to a tense chase and culminating in their capture. This opening segment establishes both the personalities of the main characters and the perilous environment of the Civil War, hinting at the dramatic developments to come in their journey.
