    "resumo": "\"You Too Can Be A Millionaire\" by Noel M. Loomis is a science fiction novella written in the early 1950s. Set in a dystopian future where citizens' lives are governed by a point system, the story delves into the absurdity of a society where money is obsolete, and individuals compete to accumulate points to avoid falling into debt. The narrative focuses on Mark Renner, who struggles to find purpose in a monotonous existence ruled by the Central Audit Bureau, the governing body that oversees the point system.  The story follows Mark as he navigates this bizarre world, marked by a lack of meaningful work and a focus on collecting points. When he meets an elderly woman, Penelope, known as \"Point-Plus-Pearlie,\" she introduces him to the underground game of manipulating the system to accrue points through creative and dishonest means. Together, they engage in increasingly elaborate schemes, culminating in Markâ€™s goal of amassing a million points. However, as he becomes more successful, he attracts the attention of the central authority, leading to a realization that the struggle for points may be a way to escape the apathy that plagues society. Ultimately, the novella critiques the emptiness of a life driven purely by systematized gain, presenting a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.
