    "resumo": "\"Forgotten Tales of Long Ago\" by E. V. Lucas is a collection of children's stories written in the early 20th century. This anthology features a selection of tales from earlier writers aimed at young readers, primarily from the late 18th to early 19th centuries, while also including a few later additions. The stories encapsulate moral lessons and lessons of good behavior, often focusing on themes like kindness, generosity, and the consequences of one's actions.   The opening portion of the collection introduces the first story, \"Dicky Random.\" This narrative follows young Richard, or Dicky, as he navigates various misadventures in his daily life, leading to humorous and chaotic consequences due to his innocence and lack of attentiveness. From misunderstanding how to read the clock to accidentally serving brandy instead of wine to guests, Dicky's antics underscore the importance of attentiveness and the repercussions of thoughtless behavior. Through all his blunders, readers are drawn into a world where lessons are gently imparted amid the humor of childhood mischief. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
