    "resumo": "\"Noli me tángere\" by José Rizal is a novel written in the late 19th century. This important work portrays the social and political landscape of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, focusing on the life of the protagonist, Crisóstomo Ibarra, who returns to the Philippines after studying in Europe. Through Ibarra's experiences and interactions, the novel addresses the themes of oppression, identity, and the struggle for reform in a society steeped in tradition and colonial rule.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Captain Tiago, host of a dinner that serves as a social gathering for various characters in Manila, reflecting the diverse society of the time. The narrative paints a vivid picture of the dinner attendees, including priests, locals, and the return of Ibarra, a young man with a noble lineage. He learns of the injustices faced by his father, who died in prison under suspicious circumstances, and the tension between the native Filipinos and the Spanish authorities. This opening portion establishes the context of Ibarra’s personal and political struggles, setting the stage for the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the pursuit of justice that will unfold throughout the novel.
