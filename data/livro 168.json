    "resumo": "\"Tales from a Rolltop Desk\" by Christopher Morley is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The narratives are set within the realm of publishing in New York, focusing on the lives and experiences of those involved in the literary world, particularly young men aspiring to make their mark, alongside their relationships and the often humorous tribulations they face. The main character introduced in the opening story is Lester Valiant, a recent Oxford graduate navigating his entry into the publishing industry while dealing with personal ambitions and romantic interests.   At the start of the collection, the dedication and acknowledgment sections provide a glimpse into Morley's admiration for the formative experiences of writers and publishers. The first story, \"The Prize Package,\" introduces Lester Valiant as he arrives in New York, full of dreams but quickly realizing that reality does not align with his romanticized expectations of the literary field. Despite his literary pretensions, Lester finds himself working in a mundane press office, grappling with his socioeconomic status, and becoming infatuated with his colleague, Pearl Denver. This tension between aspiration and reality, along with the humorous depiction of his experiences, sets the tone for Morley's witty exploration of the struggles of young literary enthusiasts.
