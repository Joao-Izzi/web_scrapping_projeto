    "resumo": "\"Ruy o escudeiro: Conto\" by Luís da Silva Mousinho de Albuquerque is a narrative poem written in the early 19th century. The work delves into themes of chivalry, love, and valor during the historical context of the Christian reconquest of Moorish territories in Portugal. Central to the story is the character Ruy, a young and brave escudeiro (squire) who is influenced by his noble lineage and the legacy of his father, a martyr to the Christian cause.  The opening of the poem sets a dramatic tone as it immerses the reader in a battlefield, showcasing victories and the heroic struggle between the Christians and Moors. Ruy is introduced amidst the chaos of war, following his military master, Pedro Affonso, and grappling with his identity and the expectations laid upon him by his deceased father. The narrative foreshadows Ruy's emotional journey as he witnesses the horrors of battle and is drawn into a romantic subplot involving Fatima, a captive maiden. The initial chapters hint at Ruy's internal conflicts between duty and desire, setting the stage for a story rich in adventure and moral challenges. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
