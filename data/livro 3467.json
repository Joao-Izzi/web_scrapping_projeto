    "resumo": "\"The Public School Word-book\" by John Stephen Farmer is a descriptive glossary compiled around the late 19th century. This work serves as a collection of words, phrases, and expressions unique to England's public schools, providing historical context for those terms and illustrating their usage through quotations from past and contemporary authors. The text is meant to appeal not only to those familiar with these institutions but also to scholars and general readers interested in linguistic development.  The opening of this glossary establishes the author's purpose and the scope of the work. Farmer expresses a desire to fill a notable gap in the documentation of school-specific vernacular, clarifying that this is not merely a collection of school slang but a detailed analytical resource. He outlines his method of gathering terms historically and compares them to other established works, emphasizing their significance in understanding English public school customs and language. The approach promises insights into both historical and modern usage as the text introduces a variety of terms relevant to public school life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
