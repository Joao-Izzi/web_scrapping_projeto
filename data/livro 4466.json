    "resumo": "\"Het Geheimzinnige Eiland\" by Jules Verne is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows a group of five characters who find themselves stranded on a mysterious island after an airship accident during a violent storm. Their survival is at stake as they navigate the challenges posed by both nature and their circumstances.  At the start of the novel, a dramatic scene unfolds as the airship carrying the main characters—Cyrus Smith, Gideon Spilett, Nab, Pencroff, and young Harbert—struggles against a fierce cyclone. The balloon does not rise as hoped, forcing them to jettison all cargo, including their supplies, in an attempt to stay airborne. After days of turmoil and uncertainty, they spot land and make a perilous descent, finally landing on an unfamiliar and desolate shore. Despite the chaos of their arrival, the opening suggests their impending adventure will combine elements of exploration and survival as they come together to face the unknown challenges of this new island.
