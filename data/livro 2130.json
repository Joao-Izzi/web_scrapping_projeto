    "resumo": "\"The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 — Volume 21 of 55\" edited by Emma Helen Blair et al. is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This particular volume focuses on the religious history and ecclesiastical affairs in the Philippines during the early 17th century, exploring the interactions between civil and religious authorities, the establishment of missions, and the conflicts that arose within these frameworks. The volume includes various documents that provide insights into the political, economic, and religious conditions of the islands during this period.  The opening of this volume outlines the context and content for the year 1624, emphasizing ecclesiastical matters such as conflicts in Manila between civil authorities and the church, along with the establishment of early Recollect missions. The introduction notes a historical account of disputes involving Archbishop Miguel García Serrano as he seeks to assert the archbishopric's authority over the religious orders operating in the region. It highlights the attempts of Serrano to impose order and discipline among missionaries, including issues related to their jurisdiction and the power dynamics at play between the church and state. This opening sets the stage for understanding the complexities of religious governance in the Philippines amidst the broader historical narrative of Spanish colonialism.
