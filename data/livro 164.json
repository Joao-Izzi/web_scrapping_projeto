    "resumo": "\"Tacitus on Germany\" by Cornelius Tacitus is a historical account written in the 1st century AD during the Roman Empire. This work provides an in-depth examination of the geography, customs, and cultural practices of the Germanic tribes encountered by the Romans. Tacitus's observations serve as an important historical document that sheds light on the lives of the ancestors of modern Teutonic nations prior to significant interactions with Roman civilization.  In this text, Tacitus meticulously describes the various tribes of Germany, detailing their social structures, beliefs, and martial practices. He notes their simplicity in lifestyle, lack of urban settlements, and communal living arrangements, as well as their deep reverence for nature and the gods. The tribes maintain distinctive customs, such as unique marriage traditions and war customs, emphasizing bravery and loyalty to their leaders. Tacitus highlights the Germans' physical characteristics and their lack of monetary wealth, while contrasting their warrior culture against the perceived decadence of Roman society. Ultimately, \"Tacitus on Germany\" serves as a valuable resource for understanding both the Germanic tribes and the Roman perspective on them during this period.
