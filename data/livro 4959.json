    "resumo": "\"Studies in Wives\" by Marie Belloc Lowndes is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative begins with Althea Scrope, the young wife of a politician, revealing her complex position within her marriage, marked by emotional distance and social pressures. As the story unfolds, it appears to explore themes of societal expectations, personal dissatisfaction, and the roles women play within the institution of marriage against a backdrop of early 1900s England.  The opening of the novel presents Althea as she reflects on her life and relationships, particularly with her husband, Perceval Scrope, and her friendship with Joan Panfillen, a woman ten years older who seems to have more influence in their social circles. Altheaâ€™s introspection reveals her feelings of inadequacy and her struggle for identity as she teeters between her youthful idealism and the harsh realities of her marriage. As she prepares for a visit from a friend, she suddenly receives a cryptic call from Joan, urging her to come over immediately, hinting at a deeper, possibly troubling development in their intertwined lives. The tension between Althea and her environment sets the stage for a narrative that promises to delve into the complexities of marital dynamics and female agency.
