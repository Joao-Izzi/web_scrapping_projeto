    "resumo": "\"The Atheist's Mass\" by Honoré de Balzac is a short story written in the early 19th century, during the times of Romanticism. The narrative explores themes of faith and skepticism, primarily through the experiences of a prominent surgeon, Desplein, and his relationship with his devoted assistant, Bianchon. This story delves into the complex nature of belief, the contradictions within human behavior, and the depth of gratitude intertwined with personal struggles.  The plot centers on Horace Bianchon, who admires his mentor, the great atheist surgeon Desplein. Bianchon is perplexed upon discovering Desplein attending mass at a church, which contradicts his known beliefs. As the story unfolds, Desplein shares the poignant story of his impoverished early years, highlighting the kindness and support of his benefactor, a humble water carrier named Bourgeat. This relationship profoundly influences Desplein's views, leading him to honor Bourgeat's memory by funding masses in his name, despite his lack of faith. Ultimately, the tale captures the intricate balance of personal experience, morality, and the human need for meaning as part of the larger question of existence and spirituality.
