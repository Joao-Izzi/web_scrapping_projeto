    "resumo": "\"Sex-Education\" by Maurice A. Bigelow is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work presents a series of lectures focused on the importance of sex education in relation to human life and societal well-being. It addresses the need for a comprehensive understanding of sexual knowledge, emphasizing that ignorance in this realm can lead to various social and health issues.  The opening of the text establishes the foundation for Bigelowâ€™s discussions on sex education, highlighting its necessity for the development of personal and social hygiene. He critiques the historical silence surrounding sexual topics, arguing that this has not preserved innocence but rather allowed harmful misconceptions to thrive. Bigelow insists that effective sex education must involve informed guidance from parents, educators, and public institutions, ensuring that young individuals are equipped to face sexual challenges with knowledge and understanding. Through this lens, he sets the stage for a deeper exploration of relevant issues, such as personal hygiene, societal diseases, and the ethical dimensions of sexual relationships.
