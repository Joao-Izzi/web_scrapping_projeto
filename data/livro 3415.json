    "resumo": "\"Life Is a Dream\" by Pedro Calderón de la Barca is a classic Spanish play written during the early 17th century, often regarded as one of the major works of the Spanish Golden Age. The play revolves around the themes of free will, fate, and the nature of reality as it explores the life of Sigismund, a prince who has been imprisoned since birth due to a prophecy that foretold his potential tyranny.  At the start of the play, the character Rosaura, disguised as a man, and her servant Clarin traverse a rugged landscape and encounter the imprisoned Sigismund. He is aware of his dismal fate and contemplates the harshness of life and the idea of liberty. The opening scenes introduce a deep philosophical dialogue about existence, choice, and the constraints of destiny. As Sigismund emerges from his dark confinement, he is filled with both hope and rage, setting the stage for a dramatic exploration of identity and power that is sure to unfold in the ensuing acts.
