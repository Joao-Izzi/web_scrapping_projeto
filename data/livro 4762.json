    "resumo": "\"Kingless Folk, and Other Addresses on Bible Animals\" by John Adams is a collection of religious discourses likely written in the late 19th century. The work explores various animals mentioned in the Bible, using them as metaphors to convey moral and spiritual lessons. By examining the behaviors and characteristics of these animals, Adams imparts wisdom about virtues such as hard work, self-reliance, and the importance of preparation.  At the start of this publication, Adams introduces his readers to the ant, illustrating the wisdom of hard work and self-reliance as embodied by this industrious creature. He reflects on biblical verses that emphasize the ant's diligence and foresight, drawing parallels between the ant's practices and valuable life lessons for young people. The opening portion sets the tone for the addresses that follow, highlighting how biblical animals serve not only as subjects of interest but also as educational tools for moral instruction and personal development.
