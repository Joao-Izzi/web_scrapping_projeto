    "resumo": "\"Life of John Knox, Fifth Edition, Vol. 2 of 2\" by Thomas M'Crie is a historical account written in the early 19th century. The book examines the life and contributions of John Knox, a key figure in the Scottish Reformation, highlighting the establishment of the Protestant church in Scotland and its impact on the nation's political and religious landscape.   The opening of this volume delves into the period following the establishment of the Protestant church in Scotland around 1560, as Knox resumes his role as a minister in Edinburgh. It presents the immediate challenges faced by Knox and his contemporaries as they work to formalize ecclesiastical governance and establish religious order amid resistance from nobility and the ongoing influence of Catholicism, particularly with the arrival of Queen Mary. Knox's efforts to advocate for church discipline and education signal the broader cultural shifts accompanying the Reformation, showcasing the interplay between religious practice and political authority in Scotland during this turbulent era.
