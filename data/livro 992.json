    "resumo": "\"British Committees, Commissions, and Councils of Trade and Plantations, 1622-1675\" by Charles M. Andrews is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book provides an in-depth examination of the various committees and councils that governed British trade and plantation affairs during the rule of James I and Charles I, as well as during the Interregnum, highlighting the political and economic implications of these governance structures.   At the start of the work, Andrews lays the groundwork for understanding the intricacies of colonial management, emphasizing that the focus will not solely be on settlement but rather on the organization and oversight of trade. He discusses the evolving nature of authority in colonial matters, illustrating how the Privy Council initially assumed control, later incorporating specialized commissions for trade and plantations. The introductory material outlines a landscape rich with historical complexities, revealing the interconnectedness of trade, colonial policies, and the political climate of 17th century England.
