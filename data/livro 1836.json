    "resumo": "\"Morning Star\" by H. Rider Haggard is a historical romance novel set in ancient Egypt, likely written during the late 19th century. The story revolves around the intrigues and power struggles among the royal family, particularly focusing on the character of Neter-Tua, a destined princess with a divine lineage. The narrative weaves themes of love, ambition, and the influence of the gods, as characters navigate the complex socio-political landscape of their time.  The beginning of \"Morning Star\" introduces readers to a dramatic world through the eyes of Prince Abi, who harbors ambitions of usurping the throne of Pharaoh. His lineage brings inherent tension as he grapples with his motherâ€™s Hyksos heritage, which stands in stark contrast to the ruling Egyptian bloodline. As tensions mount, the stage is set with prophecies and omens surrounding the birth of Neter-Tua. The novel explores the relationships and plotting amongst characters, including the loyal astrologer Kaku and Abi's fierce demeanor, foreshadowing the intertwining fates of the royal family. It presents a rich atmospheric backdrop of ancient Egypt, filled with magic, divine favor, and political scheming. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
