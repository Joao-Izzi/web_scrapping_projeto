    "resumo": "\"Een Kerstlied in Proza\" by Charles Dickens is a novella written in the early 19th century. This classic story follows the transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly man who despises Christmas and everything associated with it, through a supernatural journey involving the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and three spirits who represent Christmas past, present, and future. The novella delves into themes of redemption, compassion, and the spirit of giving, making it a quintessential holiday tale.  The opening of the novella sets the stage for Scrooge's character, establishing him as a cold-hearted and greedy figure, particularly characterized by his disdain for Christmas. Shortly after introducing Scrooge and his miserly nature, the narrative reveals the death of Marley, his deceased business partner, with a clear emphasis on the fact that Marley was \"as dead as a door-nail.\" As Scrooge prepares to close his office on Christmas Eve, he encounters his cheerful nephew, Fred, who invites him to Christmas dinner, only to be rebuffed with Scrooge's trademark cynicism. The scene not only highlights Scrooge's isolation but also hints at his impending confrontation with the ghosts that will challenge the very foundation of his heartlessness. The stage is set for a transformative night filled with haunting visits and vital life lessons. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
