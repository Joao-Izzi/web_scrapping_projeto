    "resumo": "\"The American Missionary — Volume 36, No. 11, November, 1882\" by Various is a historical publication written in the late 19th century. The contents focus on missionary efforts, particularly aimed at the Freedmen, Indigenous peoples, and immigrant communities like the Chinese. It provides insights into the work of the American Missionary Association during a time of significant social change in America.  At the start of the publication, the editors express gratitude for their past successes and outline plans for their upcoming annual meeting. They emphasize the importance of prayer within missionary work and discuss cooperation with the Woman's Home Missionary Association, eventually detailing the roles of lady missionaries. The text also highlights specific missionary activities, such as the establishment of Livingstone Missionary Hall, updates on the educational initiatives for Freedmen, the efforts in missionary work among the Indigenous population, and updates on various charitable work undertaken by the Association. This opening portion sets the stage for a deep dive into the workings of the American Missionary Association amid the dynamics of American society during that period.
