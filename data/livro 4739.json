    "resumo": "\"Isäntä ja renki\" by graf Leo Tolstoy is a short story written in the late 19th century. The narrative explores the dynamics between a master, Wasili Andrejitsh Brehunov, and his servant, Nikita, in a rural Russian setting. The story delves into themes of class, morality, and the human experience, particularly focusing on the struggles and relationships faced by the characters.  At the start of the story, a winter celebration is underway in the village, where Wasili Andrejitsh is occupied with hosting guests before hastily making plans to engage in a profitable timber deal. Nikita, the only sober servant, prepares the horse for the journey. His backstory reveals a man of respectable character yet burdened by personal demons—specifically, his battles with alcohol that have strained his family life. As the duo sets out into the cold, their contrasting situations begin to unfold against a backdrop of discussion about Nikita's aspirations to own a horse and the ever-present tension of servitude. The opening introduces significant characters and sets the stage for a deeper exploration of their lives along with the harsh realities they face. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
