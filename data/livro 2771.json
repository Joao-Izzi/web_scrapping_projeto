    "resumo": "\"The Treasure of Heaven: A Romance of Riches\" by Marie Corelli is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around David Helmsley, a wealthy but deeply unhappy man, who reflects on his life, love, and the true value of wealth. As the narrative unfolds, it examines themes of love, loss, and the emptiness of material success, particularly through Helmsley's interactions with the young Lucy Sorrel, whom he has cared for since childhood.  At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to the bustling atmosphere of London on a June night, juxtaposed against Helmsley's feelings of solitude and despair. After a lively evening event celebrating Lucy's twenty-first birthday, Helmsley grapples with his aging and the futility of his wealth. The opening chapters depict a conversation between Helmsley and his solicitor, Sir Francis Vesey, revealing Helmsley's disillusionment with life and the superficiality of society. As he ruminates on his past, including the painful memories of lost love and family, he begins to ponder his legacy, feeling an existential dread as he contemplates who will inherit his fortune. The rich descriptive language and the introspective dialogue set the stage for a poignant exploration of the human condition. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
