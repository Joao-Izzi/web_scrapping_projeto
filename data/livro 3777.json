    "resumo": "\"My Terminal Moraine\" by Frank R. Stockton is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Walter Cuthbert, a young man who, after the death of his father, finds himself in a state of melancholy, unable to take much interest in life until he falls in love with Agnes Havelot. His delicate situation becomes complicated, as he feels trapped by his lack of wealth and Agnes's father's disapproval. Ultimately, the book addresses themes of love, ambition, and unexpected fortune as Walter discovers a remarkable ice deposit beneath his land.  The narrative follows Walter's journey of transformation, beginning with his idle and despondent life as a landowner. After being inspired by his friend Tom Burton, a geologist, Walter decides to improve his estate in hopes of winning Agnes's father's approval. When he accidentally uncovers a massive deposit of ice, initially considered a bizarre curiosity, it opens the door to wealth and success. The story unfolds as Walter grapples with his new fortune, ultimately leading to a dramatic incident where he becomes trapped in the ice mine. His salvation by Agnes and the subsequent acceptance of their love culminate in both a romantic and social resolution, illustrating how fortunes can change in the most unexpected ways.
