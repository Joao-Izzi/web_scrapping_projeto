    "resumo": "\"Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman\" by Edith Van Dyne is a fictional work likely written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around two main characters, Mary Louise and Josie O'Gorman, who embark on adventures that blend themes of charity, community, and personal growth. As Mary Louise grapples with her newfound status as an heiress, the narrative explores her determination to make a positive impact on the lives of children in need, particularly through the Children's Home Society.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Mary Louise, who has recently gone through the trials of losing her grandfather and husband. Now facing a brighter future with the return of her husband and the restoration of her family fortune, she takes decisive action by planning to donate her old family home to the Children's Home Society to help orphaned children. Alongside Josie, her friend and aspiring detective, Mary Louise develops strong commitments to the welfare of the children, which sets the stage for their deeper involvement in the local community and unravels certain mysteries, particularly concerning two children named Peter and Polly who have suffered under the care of a dubious woman named Cousin Dink. The opening chapters establish a heartwarming narrative filled with friendship and the complexities of caring for others. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
