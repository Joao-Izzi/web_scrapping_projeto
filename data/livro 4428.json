    "resumo": "\"De Pop van Elisabeth Gehrke\" by Dina Mollinger-Hooyer is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Elizabeth Gehrke, who is depicted as a deeply introspective character grappling with grief and loss, particularly stemming from the impact of war on her life and relationships. As she navigates her way through memories and emotions, the narrative unfolds her journey of healing and self-discovery.  At the start of the novel, Elizabeth stands on the bustling Riva degli Schiavoni in Venice, taking in the vibrant atmosphere of one last morning in the city she cherishes. Reflecting on memories of her late husband, Heinz, she is haunted by the trauma of his death during the war and how it has affected her interactions with others. The opening sets a tone of bittersweet nostalgia as she enjoys the beauty and tranquility of Venice, contrasted with the dark presence of her past. While she is captivated by the surroundings and the elegance of the gondolas, her mind drifts to heavier thoughts about the war and societal perceptions of her as a German widow in Holland, revealing her internal struggle and longing for peace amidst turmoil.
