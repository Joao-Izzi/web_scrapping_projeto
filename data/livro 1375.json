    "resumo": "\"Miss Bretherton\" by Mrs. Humphry Ward is a novel written during the late 19th century that explores the world of art and theater in London. Centered around the young actress Isabel Bretherton, the story delves into themes of beauty, talent, and the challenges faced by artists in society, particularly focusing on the superficial judgments they encounter.  The opening of \"Miss Bretherton\" establishes a vivid scene at a private view at the Royal Academy, where various artistic and social figures gather. Eustace Kendal, a critical observer of the art world, encounters the titular character, Miss Bretherton, who garners immediate attention for her striking beauty. Conversations among characters reveal differing opinions on her budding talent and the superficial nature of English audiences. The narrative hints at Miss Bretherton's complex background, her recent rise to fame, and the pressures she faces as an actress. Meanwhile, Kendal grapples with his admiration for her beauty versus his critical stance on her acting abilities, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of character dynamics and societal expectations throughout the novel.
