    "resumo": "\"Variétés Historiques et Littéraires\" by Édouard Fournier is a collection of rare and curious prose and verse pieces written in the mid-19th century. This compilation reflects on historical events, societal themes, and literary expressions from different periods, with a particular focus on lesser-known works that shed light on the cultural landscape of the times it encompasses.   The opening of the work presents a series of poetic pieces, part of a broader context of political and social unrest in France, particularly during the Fronde. It showcases satirical commentary on the conflicts and perceptions of contemporary figures and societal norms, deploying humor and irony to address serious themes of war, food scarcity, and civic duty. The narratives often reflect a collective sentiment among Parisians, capturing the atmosphere of urgency and resilience amidst the turmoil as various social classes respond to their circumstances, revealing the multifaceted nature of urban life during a crisis.
