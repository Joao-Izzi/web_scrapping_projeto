    "resumo": "\"Natural History of the Prairie Vole (Mammalian Genus Microtus)\" by E. W. Jameson is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. The book focuses on the prairie vole, a small mammal, detailing various aspects of its biology, habitat, diet, reproduction, and parasitic relationships. It offers a comprehensive examination of the species within the context of its ecosystem in northeastern Kansas, specifically around Lawrence.  The book is structured methodically, beginning with an introduction to the prairie vole's physical characteristics and behaviors. It discusses the vole's feeding habits, nesting behaviors, and environmental interactions, supported by observational data gathered from multiple specimens over an eleven-month period. In addition to ecological insights, it delves into various parasitic relationships that affect the prairie vole, such as the types of fleas, lice, and mites that inhabit its fur. The reproductive patterns are also explored, highlighting seasonal changes in litter sizes and the implications for population dynamics. Overall, Jameson's work presents an exhaustive study of the prairie vole, making it a valuable resource for researchers and anyone interested in mammalian ecology.
