    "resumo": "\"Mythology in Marble\" by Louie M. Bell is a collection of essays on mythology and sculpture written in the early 20th century. This work focuses on the myths and legends that inspired some of the most significant pieces of classical sculpture, bridging the gap between art and mythology for a contemporary audience. Through a poetic lens, it explores figures from ancient mythology, likely highlighting their cultural significance and artistic representations.  The opening of the book presents a preface that outlines the author's goals, emphasizing the need for a general understanding of classical myths in order to appreciate the art inspired by these stories. Bell notes the practical constraints of modern life that limit people's ability to study mythology in depth but insists on the value of having suggestive knowledge that can enhance one's experience of art. The text blends concise mythological narratives with interpretations and artistic descriptions, starting with foundational figures such as Jupiter and Juno, and hints at the aesthetic and symbolic meanings behind various sculptures, thereby setting the stage for a deeper exploration of each mythological character in relation to their artistic representation.
