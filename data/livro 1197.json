    "resumo": "\"Geoffrey's Victory; or, The Double Deception\" by Mrs. Georgie Sheldon is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story begins with various characters introduced in a dramatic and mysterious setting, focusing on a young physician named Dr. Thomas Turner who gets involved in an urgent case linked to a beautiful young mother and her newborn daughter. As the plot unfolds, themes of deception, maternal sacrifice, and societal judgments emerge, emphasizing the struggles of the main characters.  At the start of the book, the reader is plunged into a cold winter night in Boston, where Dr. Turner receives a troubling summons to attend to a mysterious woman, Mrs. Marston, who is linked to a newly born child. Strikingly beautiful but enigmatic, Mrs. Marston reveals her intent to abandon her child, a decision that shocks the doctor and sets off a chain of events steeped in mystery and moral dilemmas. The opening chapters introduce the depths of Mrs. Marstonâ€™s predicaments, showcasing her wealth and social status but contrasting it with her emotional detachment from her child. As Dr. Turner grapples with the implications of her intentions, the stage is set for a tale filled with intrigue and the potential for redemption. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
