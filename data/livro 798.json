    "resumo": "\"World of the Mad\" by Poul Anderson is a science fiction novel likely written in the early 1950s. The narrative explores the complexities of life on the alien planet Tanith, where the protagonist, Langdon, grapples with the challenges of immortality while trying to protect his wife, Eileen, from the sanity-destroying effects of their extraordinary environment. The book delves into themes of love, fear, and the alien nature of reality, raising questions about the meaning of life, immortality, and the struggle between sanity and madness.  The story follows Langdon, who has achieved immortality on Tanith, a vibrant yet treacherous world full of bizarre and haunting phenomena. While he has adapted to the planet's strange realities, Eileen, his young wife, struggles to cope with the chaotic environment, frequently experiencing fear and hallucinations. As the narrative unfolds, Langdon's love for Eileen deepens, but he is torn between his desire to keep her by his side and the reality that her mental health deteriorates in this alien landscape. The tension culminates in a heart-wrenching decision, as Langdon must confront whether to sacrifice his own immortality or abandon the love of his life to a more \"normal\" existence back on Earth. Ultimately, the novel grapples with the profound implications of living forever in a world that constantly defies normalcy and understanding. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
