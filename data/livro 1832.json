    "resumo": "\"The Tatler, Volume 1\" by Sir Richard Steele and Joseph Addison is a collection of essays and articles written in the early 18th century. This periodical, which began publication in 1709, aimed to offer commentary on social manners, public affairs, and domestic life, while also providing entertainment for its readers. It is famously associated with its fictional editor, Isaac Bickerstaff, who critiques society, discusses contemporary topics, and shares personal anecdotes.  The opening of \"The Tatler\" introduces the concept of a paper designed to engage and enlighten its audience. Steele outlines his goal to serve both as a source of news and entertainment, particularly for women, and presents himself as an astute observer of the human condition. The first articles illustrate various scenes and character sketches from London life, including humorous tales of a lovesick gentleman and theatrical performances, all enlivened by wit and social commentary. As such, the publication seeks to pull back the curtain on the follies and vices present in society, while promoting virtues like simplicity and authenticity.
