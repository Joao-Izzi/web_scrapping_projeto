    "resumo": "\"Faust [Part 1]\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a tragic play written in the late 18th century. The work delves into themes of knowledge, ambition, and the quest for meaning through the character of Dr. Faust, a scholar who finds himself disillusioned with the limits of human knowledge and seeks fulfillment through a pact with the devil in the form of Mephistopheles.  The opening of \"Faust\" introduces the titular character, Dr. Faust, who voices his despair over his accumulated knowledge that has not brought him true understanding or satisfaction. Despite being a respected scholar, Faust is haunted by feelings of emptiness and the realization that traditional forms of knowledge are insufficient. As he contemplates the limitations of human understanding within his dim study, Faust yearns for a more profound experience of life and decides to turn to magic in hopes of transcending his mortal limitations. His frustration culminates in a powerful invocation that attracts the attention of Mephistopheles, setting the stage for the unfolding drama as Faust engages with the devilish figure in pursuit of deeper truths and existential fulfillment.
