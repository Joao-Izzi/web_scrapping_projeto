    "resumo": "\"Industrial Cuba\" by Robert P. Porter is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book offers a detailed study of the commercial and industrial landscape of Cuba following the end of Spanish rule and delves into the country's potential for economic recovery and growth under American influence after the War of 1898. It serves as a report to President McKinley, aiming to explore opportunities for American capital and intervention in Cuba's reconstruction.  The opening of the work sets the stage for an examination of Cuba's dire economic status after the devastation wrought by war. Porter outlines the rich natural resources available and juxtaposes them with the negative impacts of Spanish colonization, which left the population and the economy severely depleted. His observations, drawn from extensive inquiries across various regions of Cuba, highlight both the challenges and the untapped potential for development. He emphasizes that without addressing the systemic issues rooted in mismanagement and exploitation, Cuba cannot reach its full economic capacity, advocating for a focus on industrial recovery as a pathway to broader societal progress.
