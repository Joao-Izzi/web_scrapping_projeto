    "resumo": "\"The Butterfly Book\" by W. J. Holland is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work serves as a popular guide aimed at educating readers on the butterflies of North America, providing insight into their life cycles, capture, and preservation. The book promises to appeal to both amateur collectors and scholars, featuring detailed illustrations and information on the various species found on the continent.  The opening of this guide introduces readers to the concept of collecting, particularly among young naturalists, and emphasizes the beauty and fascination of butterflies as collectible insects. Holland addresses the gap in accessible literature by noting that while European collectors benefit from well-illustrated manuals, North American enthusiasts have lacked similar resources. He outlines the purpose of the book: to fill this void, offering practical guidance not only on butterfly identification but also on preservation techniques, aiming to inspire a greater appreciation for the insect world while diverting attention from the more threatened bird species.
