    "resumo": "\"The Lost Mountain: A Tale of Sonora\" by Captain Mayne Reid is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds in the Sonoran desert and follows a caravan of miners, led by the professional gold-seeker Pedro Vicente, as they journey toward a newly discovered gold mine. Among the characters are Don Estevan Villanueva and Robert Tresillian, representing different ethnic backgrounds, who face the peril of a waterless environment and the looming threat of hostile Native Americans.  At the start of the tale, the caravan struggles through a drought-stricken plain, with animals distressed from lack of water. The arrival of Pedro Vicente, who claims to have sighted the \"Lost Mountain,\" brings a glimmer of hope for the miners. As they make their way toward the mountain, the group is ultimately faced with the dual challenges of survival amidst harsh conditions and the imminent threat of a marauding band of Coyoteros, who are determined to exact vengeance on the miners. The opening is rich in detail, establishing the characters, setting, and overarching conflicts that will drive the narrative forward. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
