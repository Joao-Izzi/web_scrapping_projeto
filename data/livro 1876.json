    "resumo": "\"Making People Happy\" by Thompson Buchanan is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around Cicily Hamilton, a young bride who is grappling with her role in marriage and her desire for purpose beyond domesticity. Set against a backdrop of social issues concerning women's rights, the story explores the dynamics within the Civitas Club, where women converge to discuss the emancipation of their gender while also revealing personal conflicts and ambitions.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Cicily as she presides over an enthusiastic yet chaotic meeting of the Civitas Club, where the members, a mix of spirited women, are in a frenzy about women's rights and societal roles. Cicily struggles to maintain order and ultimately reveals her frustration with both the club's lack of direction and her own dissatisfaction in her marriage. As she navigates the tumult of the club's discussions and her tumultuous emotions, the narrative sets the stage for her journey to find personal fulfillment and to confront the expectations placed upon her as a wife and a member of society.
