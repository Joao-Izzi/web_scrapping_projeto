    "resumo": "\"The Sons of Kai: The Story the Indian Told\" by Henry Beston is a children's storybook published in the early 20th century, specifically in the 1920s. This book offers a fictional account of Navajo mythology, focusing on the adventures of twin brothers brought up by their mother, Kai, after their father, Hah-Tse-Yalti, the Talking God, returns to the realm of gods. The narrative encapsulates elements of traditional Navajo culture and the significance of healing songs, presenting themes of family, courage, and the connection between the natural and spiritual worlds.  In the story, the twins face various challenges after accidentally getting caught in the mischief of a god, leading to one becoming blind and the other lame. Their journey takes them across the desert and mountains as they seek healing, guided by their father, Hah-Tse-Yalti. They learn the importance of the four sacred mountains and the healing song associated with them. Subsequently, they prove their worth to the Hopi people, who guard the three sacred stones essential for their healing. Ultimately, through resilience and the wisdom imparted by their father, they succeed in regaining their health and return to their canyon home, sharing their newfound knowledge and the healing song with their community, thus becoming great heroes of their people.
