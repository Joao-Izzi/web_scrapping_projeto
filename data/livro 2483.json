    "resumo": "\"Extracts from 'Sikes on Parochial Communion' by Thomas Sikes\" is a theological treatise and compilation written during the mid-19th century. The work seeks to address the issues of episcopal authority, schism, and ecclesiastical obedience within the context of Christian worship and governance. It reflects Sikes' deep engagement with scripture and church history while aiming to clarify the principles of church authority and the obligations of parishioners to their spiritual leaders.  The text presents a series of reflections on the nature of episcopacy, citing historical precedents and scriptural references to argue against schism and division within the Church. Sikes emphasizes the spiritual authority of bishops as successors of the Apostles, reinforcing the belief that such authority is essential for maintaining unity in faith and practice. Throughout the extracts, he highlights the dangers of disobedience and the necessity of adherence to the established order of worship, warning that schism leads to theological error and moral decay. By drawing on early Christian writings and biblical narratives, Sikes advocates for a return to ecclesiastical authority grounded in both tradition and divine appointment.
