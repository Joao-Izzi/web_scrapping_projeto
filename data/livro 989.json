    "resumo": "\"Colonel Starbottle's Client\" by Bret Harte is a novella written in the late 19th century. This narrative offers a glimpse into the life of Colonel Starbottle, a flamboyant attorney in a small California town, as he navigates a complex case involving his client, Jo Corbin, who reveals a dark past and an internal struggle between guilt and responsibility following the killing of his former partner. The storyline sets the stage for a blend of humor, wit, and commentary on morality amidst the backdrop of frontier justice.  The opening of the novella introduces Colonel Starbottle and establishes his boisterous personality as he ceaselessly engages in the legal profession after his political campaigns. His encounter with Jo Corbin, a discontented and guilt-ridden man, reveals the gravity of Corbin's situation—the guilt from a fatal altercation with his partner. As the Colonel listens to Corbin’s tale of remorse and intention to provide financial support to his victim's family, he becomes embroiled in a moral dilemma that impacts both men.
