    "resumo": "\"Vice in its Proper Shape\" by Anonymous is a moralistic work written during the late 18th century. The book is a collection of cautionary tales aimed at children, illustrating the consequences of vice through fantastical tales of naughty boys and girls who are transformed into animals reflecting their basest characteristics. The text employs allegory to convey important morals related to behavior, obedience, and the importance of virtues.  In this book, the benevolent character Mr. Wiseman guides a group of children through a strange museum where they encounter several animals, each inhabited by the soul of a misbehaving child. For example, Jack Idle becomes an ass due to his stubbornness and ignorance, while Anthony Greedyguts is transformed into a pig, reflecting his gluttonous nature. Through each transformation story, readers learn about the vices that led to the characters' fates, ultimately serving as cautionary lessons encouraging good behavior and moral integrity. The overarching theme emphasizes that the consequences of one's actions are inescapable, urging young readers to adopt virtuous conduct. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
