    "resumo": "\"The War Myth in United States History\" by C. H. Hamlin is a historical account written in the late 1920s. The book critically examines the various wars in which the United States has participated, questioning the prevailing narratives surrounding their necessity and outcomes. Hamlin aims to uncover the complexities and contradictions of these conflicts, suggesting that they often resulted more in shame and destruction than glory.  The opening of the book introduces the author's thesis regarding the myth of American wars, positing that many citizens have accepted a fatalistic view of history that ignores the role of choice and responsibility. Hamlin emphasizes the importance of examining historical conflicts with a critical lens, leveraging statistics about war expenditures and casualties to illustrate the scale of American military engagement. He hints at the biases involved in the glorification of war and suggests that understanding these historical narratives is crucial for learning from the past and preventing future conflicts.
