    "resumo": "\"La Chanson de la croisade contre les Albigeois\" by Guillaume and Anelier is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This text comprises a collection of poems and narratives centered on the catastrophic events of the Albigensian Crusade, which took place in the early 13th century as the Church sought to eliminate heresy in the south of France. It reveals the experiences and motivations of various figures involved, providing insight into the conflict between the Crusaders and the Albigensians.  The opening of the work introduces the context of the Albigensian Crusade through two main poetic narratives: the first, by Guilhem de Tudela, chronicles events that transpired between 1207 and 1213, particularly focusing on the actions of the church and the Crusaders. The second part, authored by an anonymous troubadour, depicts the events surrounding the war starting from 1213. The text begins with the assassination of Pierre de Castelnau, leading to calls for a Crusade and detailing the subsequent bloody siege of Béziers, where countless lives were lost. As it unfolds, the narrative transitions into various other pivotal events, showcasing the civil unrest, battles, and the fervor of both sides, as well as their motivations and grievances amidst this tragic conflict.
