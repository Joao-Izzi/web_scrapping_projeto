    "resumo": "\"Magic London\" by Netta Syrett is a children's fantasy novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows a young girl named Betty who embarks on magical journeys through time, guided by her eccentric godmother. Through these adventures, Betty discovers the rich history of London, seeing it transform from Roman times to the Middle Ages, thus awakening her appreciation for the city she initially found dull and overwhelming.  The opening of the book introduces Betty, a girl who has just moved to London and is reluctant to embrace her new home, which she perceives as big and ugly. Upon finally meeting her godmother, who is keen on showing her the hidden wonders of London, Bettyâ€™s opinions begin to shift as her godmother hints at having a special way of experiencing the city. This intriguing promise sets the stage for their journey, as they prepare to explore the magical aspects of London's history together, beginning with a journey back to Roman London. The narrative captures Betty's initial reluctance, her curiosity, and the spark of excitement for the adventures ahead. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
