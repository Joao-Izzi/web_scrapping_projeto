    "resumo": "\"The Constant Couple; Or, A Trip to the Jubilee: A Comedy, in Five Acts\" by George Farquhar is a comedic play written in the early 18th century. The narrative revolves around the adventures and romantic entanglements of characters such as Sir Harry Wildair and Colonel Standard as they navigate social expectations and rivalries in pursuit of love.   The opening of the play introduces viewers to a lively discourse among the characters in a park, where Vizard learns about Angelica's rejection of his affections due to his supposed lack of sincerity. Concurrently, Colonel Standard laments his disbanding from the military, humorously reflecting on societal norms and his own unfulfilled romantic aspirations. As Sir Harry Wildair makes his grand entrance, he provides insight into his carefree demeanor while boasting about his recent exploits abroad. This initial act sets the stage for a tale filled with cunning, rivalry, and the pursuit of love, characteristic of Farquhar's witty social comedies. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
