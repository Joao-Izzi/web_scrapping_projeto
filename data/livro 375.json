    "resumo": "\"Lord Lister No. 0461: De moord op John Cormick\" by Matull, Blankensee, and Hageman is a thrilling detective novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the notorious murder of a wealthy industrialist, John Cormick, who is found dead in Central Park, leading to a resurgence of fear associated with a criminal gang known as \"Het Kwade Oog.\" The main character, Lord Edward Lister, also known as John Raffles, aims to prove a wealthy man's claims of being inabrakvrij (burglary-proof) by engaging in a daring investigation.  The opening of the novel introduces a gripping murder mystery that unsettles the affluent residents of New York. When John Cormick is discovered murdered with a threatening note from a criminal gang, the alarm is raised about the potential threat posed by the gang's reemergence. The narrative shifts to Raffles, who, intrigued by Cormick's audacious declaration of having an impenetrable home, decides to challenge it. Engaging in strategic discussions with his companion Charly Brand, Raffles plans not only to investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder but also to uncover vulnerabilities within Cormick's heavily fortified mansion, setting the stage for an intricate and suspenseful plot.
