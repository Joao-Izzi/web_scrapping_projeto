    "resumo": "\"Orlando Furioso, Tomo I\" by Lodovico Ariosto is an epic poem written in the early 16th century. This work weaves a rich tapestry of romance and adventure, centering around the tumultuous love story of Orlando and the beautiful Angélica amidst a backdrop of legendary knights and battles. The narrative explores themes of love, honor, and madness, with Orlando as a central character turning furiously mad due to his unrequited love for Angélica.  The opening of \"Orlando Furioso\" introduces readers to the epic's grand scope, beginning with an invocation to the muse to inspire the poet in recounting heroic tales. We are promptly introduced to a love triangle involving the infatuated Orlando, the fleeing Angélica, and the ambitious knight Reinaldo, who both vie for her affection. As Angélica escapes through the forest, the poem sets the stage for various knights, including the proud Ferragús, leading to encounters filled with challenges, combat, and the intertwining of love and rivalry. This dynamic start captivates the reader’s interest and hints at the ensuing adventures that will define the saga of these formidable characters. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
