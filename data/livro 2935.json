    "resumo": "\"The Mirrors of Washington\" by Clinton W. Gilbert and John Kirby is a political analysis written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the complexities of American presidential history, specifically analyzing the characters and ideologies of presidents Warren G. Harding and Woodrow Wilson. It reflects on how these figures exemplify broader trends in American politics and society.  The opening of the book provides a detailed and vivid introductory context regarding key political figures of the time, emphasizing their educational backgrounds, political careers, and personal characteristics. Notably, it contrasts the public perceptions and leadership styles of Harding and Wilson, positioning Harding as the \"just folks\" candidate who represents the average American voter, while Wilson is depicted as an idealistic, yet ultimately flawed leader. The narrative sets the stage for an exploration of Harding's electoral appeal amidst a populace fatigued by Wilson's progressive ideals, suggesting a shift in American political thought from idealism to pragmatism.
