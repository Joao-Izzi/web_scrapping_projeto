    "resumo": "\"The Three Brothers; vol. 2/3\" by Mrs. Oliphant is a novel likely written during the late 19th century. The book explores themes of art, ambition, and personal relationships through its main character, Laurie Renton, who is a painter navigating his professional and artistic journey. His struggles with self-confidence and external pressures from friends and critics shape the narrative as he seeks recognition both for himself and for those around him, particularly his friend Reginald Suffolk.  At the start of the novel, Laurie is entangled in a web of expectations and opinions regarding his artwork. Discouraged by criticism, he considers abandoning his ambitions and returns to the comfort of play. Friends advise him to focus on simpler art, but Laurie wrestles with the weight of their advice while also yearning to uplift his friend Suffolk, a struggling artist. This relationship becomes a focal point as Laurie decides to support Suffolk's artistic endeavors while grappling with his own feelings of inadequacy. The opening sets the tone for Laurieâ€™s introspective journey amid the dynamics of artistic life in the Victorian era. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
