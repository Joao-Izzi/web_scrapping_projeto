Moorman is a collection of dialect poetry that showcases the rich literary heritage of Yorkshire, primarily composed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This anthology features both traditional poems and works from various authors renowned for their contributions to Yorkshire dialect literature. The likely topic of the collection revolves around the everyday lives, customs, and experiences of Yorkshire people, expressed through the distinctive and lively vernacular of the region.

He emphasizes the book's unification of poems across different dialects and highlights the importance of capturing the authentic speech of Yorkshire. The first poem presented is \"A Yorkshire Dialogue between an Awd Wife, a Lass, and a Butcher,\" a lively and realistic exchange that vividly represents the dialect and daily occurrences in rural Yorkshire, setting the tone for the collection as an exploration of local culture and language through poetry.
