    "resumo": "\"Introdução à Archeologia da Península Ibérica\" by Augusto Filipe Simões is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work focuses on archaeological studies in the Iberian Peninsula, specifically exploring prehistoric antiquities and their significance in understanding human civilization's evolution.   The opening of the book discusses the transformative nature of historical and social sciences under the influence of natural sciences, emphasizing the role of archaeology in this process. The author elaborates on the need for a rigorous approach to understanding prehistoric artifacts, which lack the written traditions that guide historians. He also critiques past misconceptions about the origins of human civilization and highlights important archaeological findings that have been overlooked or misunderstood due to prevailing beliefs. This initial exploration sets the stage for a detailed examination of prehistoric tools and their implications for our understanding of human progress in the Iberian context.
