    "resumo": "\"Introduction to the Science of Sociology\" by Robert Ezra Park and E. W. Burgess is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work serves as a foundational text for understanding sociology, outlining its principles, methodologies, and the importance of observation in studying societal phenomena. The text integrates a wide range of sociological materials, conceptual frameworks, and examples, aimed at making sociology an interactive and engaging discipline for students and researchers alike.  The opening of the book details the authors' intent to create a comprehensive yet systematic approach to sociology that encourages reader participation and critical thinking. They emphasize the need for students to observe social phenomena actively and collect their data, moving beyond passive learning. Through various excerpts and investigations, the authors set the stage for a scientific understanding of society, proposing that sociology not only needs to gather facts but to analyze the opinions and behaviors that influence social structures. The introduction highlights the need for a clear distinction between sociological and historical methods, establishing a framework for the successive chapters that delve into specific sociological themes and concepts.
