    "resumo": "\"Industrial Arts Design\" by William H. Varnum is a textbook of practical methods for students, teachers, and craftsmen, written in the early 20th century. This comprehensive guide focuses on the principles of industrial design, specifically for materials such as wood, clay, and metals, and aims to bridge the gap between design theory and practical application in the industrial arts. The book is intended not only for high school and college students but also serves as a valuable reference for educators in the field.  The opening of the textbook presents the author's motivation for writing it and outlines its structure and intended use. Varnum emphasizes the need for a practical approach to design in the industrial arts, highlighting the importance of adapting design principles to specific materials and real-world applications. He introduces the core divisions of industrial arts design, including structural, contour, and surface enrichment, and stresses the necessity of clear communication and understanding between design instructors and students to foster creativity and individuality in crafted works. Each chapter is designed to build upon these foundational concepts, laying the groundwork for effective design education in various industrial contexts.
