    "resumo": "\"The Best British Short Stories of 1922\" by John Cournos et al. is a collection of short stories edited within the early 20th century. The compilation showcases the finest narratives published in British and Irish periodicals during a specific timeframe, preserving notable contributions to the art of the short story from that era. The collection includes a variety of tales that span different themes and styles, reflecting the social and cultural dynamics of the time.  The opening of the book presents an introduction by John Cournos, which reveals the thought process behind curating the anthology. He discusses the evolution of the short story form and the challenges it faces in modern literature. He notes that many contemporary narratives often lack sufficient substance and form, and emphasizes the importance of both elements in crafting a compelling story. The introduction sets a contemplative tone as Cournos invites readers to reflect on the nature of storytelling, which continues into the subsequent selections of stories featured in the volume.
