    "resumo": "\"Mental Radio\" by Upton Sinclair is a scientific exploration written in the early 20th century that delves into the realm of psychic phenomena, particularly telepathy. The book focuses on experiments conducted by Sinclair and his wife, Mary Craig Sinclair, who demonstrates notable telepathic abilities through various tests. This work aims to provide credible evidence supporting the existence of telepathy, challenging conventional skepticism toward such claims.  The opening of \"Mental Radio\" presents the context and motivation behind the Sinclairs' journey into the study of telepathy. Upton Sinclair reflects on his long-standing curiosity regarding psychic phenomena and his wife's newfound abilities, detailing the methodology of their experiments. They engage in a series of telepathic tests involving drawing objects remotely, with Mary Craig successfully reproducing images that Upton has drawn out of her view. This beginning sets the stage for the detailed evidence and accounts of their experiments to follow, making it clear that the narrative will blend personal experiences with rigorous scientific inquiry.
