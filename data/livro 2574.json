    "resumo": "\"The Law Inevitable\" by Louis Couperus is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Cornélie de Retz van Loo, a young divorced woman traveling in Rome, seeking solace and a fresh start in life. As she navigates her new environment, the novel explores themes of identity, societal constraints, and the complexity of human relationships, set against the backdrop of a vibrant yet complex city.  At the start of the book, the reader is introduced to Cornélie as she arrives at the Marchesa Belloni's boarding house in Rome. A mix of excitement and trepidation fills her as she settles into her new surroundings, and the initial interactions with other boarders reveal a rich tapestry of personalities, including the charming Mr. Rudyard, who seems to have a hidden agenda. Cornélie’s observations about her fellow guests and her inner musings about her past and future gradually paint a portrait of a woman in search of meaning amidst her disillusionment with the art and society she hoped would provide her solace. The opening chapters set the stage for her journey of self-discovery, as she grapples with loneliness, cultural expectations, and her desire to forge a new path in life.
