    "resumo": "\"Engineering Reminiscences Contributed to 'Power' and 'American Machinist'\" by Charles T. Porter is a memoir and collection of engineering experiences written in the early 20th century. The book reflects on the author's journey through the field of mechanical engineering, detailing significant inventions, challenges faced, and the evolution of technology during his lifetime. It likely focuses on the development of steam engineering and related inventions, showcasing Porter's contributions to the field.  At the start of the narrative, Porter introduces himself by outlining his background, from his birth in Auburn, New York, to his education and initial career as a lawyer. He describes his transition into engineering sparked by a series of mechanical mishaps and ventures into invention, including the development of a stone-dressing machine. Porter humorously recounts his early misadventures in mechanics and the lessons he learned, which set the stage for his future innovations. The opening also foreshadows the introduction of significant engineering concepts and figures central to the evolution of steam power and machinery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
