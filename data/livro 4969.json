    "resumo": "\"Savva and the Life of Man: Two Plays by Leonid Andreyev\" by Leonid Andreyev is a collection of dramatic works written during the early 20th century. The plays delve into the complexities of human existence, exploring themes such as suffering, despair, and the search for meaning in life, framed against the backdrop of a society in turmoil. The characters in these plays grapple with profound philosophical questions, with Savva serving as a central figure in one play, representing a blend of rebellion and existential inquiry.  The opening of \"Savva\" introduces the mundane yet oppressive atmosphere of a monastic suburb where the characters are engaged in everyday tasks amidst heat and silence. Pelagueya and Lipa, two women in the household, express their frustrations about life and labor while discussing Savva, who is depicted as a carefree presence, playing with children. Tensions arise around Savva's character; he is seen as disconnected from the harsh realities surrounding him, prompting a range of reactions from the other charactersâ€”from admiration to contempt. Through brief dialogues, we glimpse into Savva's complex persona, marked by confusion and a desire to confront harsh truths about life and human suffering, setting the stage for deeper explorations throughout the play.
