    "resumo": "\"Narzißmus als Doppelrichtung\" by Lou Andreas-Salomé is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work explores the concept of narcissism from a psychoanalytic perspective, primarily focusing on the theories introduced by Sigmund Freud. Salomé unpacks the complexity of narcissism, examining its implications for self-love, object love, and the experience of individual identity.  The opening of the text delves deeply into Freud's understanding of narcissism and its significance in psychoanalysis. Salomé discusses the dual nature of narcissism—highlighting both its selfish and libidinous aspects—as she reflects on childhood development as part of the conceptually layered nature of identity formation. She introduces a poignant example from her observations of a child transitioning from innocent self-love to the complexities of recognizing separate identities and relationships, setting the stage for a broader examination of how these psychological dynamics affect interpersonal connections and artistic expression.
