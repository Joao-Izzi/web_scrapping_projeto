    "resumo": "\"An Englishman in Paris: Notes and Recollections\" by Albert D. Vandam is a collection of autobiographical reflections and observations written in the late 19th century. The book captures the bohemian spirit of the Quartier-Latin during the late 1830s, illustrating the lives, eccentricities, and social dynamics of artists and students in Paris. Through Vandamâ€™s narratives, readers are introduced to colorful characters and the lively atmosphere that characterized the artistic community of the time.  The opening of this work describes the Quartier-Latin as it was experienced by the author, who recounts his early interactions with its notable figures and institutions, particularly focusing on \"La Childebert\", a renowned meeting place for artists. Vandam paints a vivid picture of the raucous life in this enclave, detailing practical jokes, artistic aspirations, and the vibrant personalities that populated the area. He introduces readers to the caricature of Bouginier, which became a local sensation, and explores the image's impact on the inhabitants of the quarter. The narrative reflects a blend of humor and nostalgia, highlighting the informal, yet passionate life dedicated to art, creativity, and camaraderie among young artists.
