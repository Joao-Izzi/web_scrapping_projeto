    "resumo": "\"Catilina\" by Henrik Ibsen is a dramatic play written in the mid-19th century. The work centers around Lucius Catilina, a Roman nobleman beset by political turmoil and personal ambitions, exploring themes of power, betrayal, and the conflict between individual desires and societal expectations. As Catilina grapples with his fate and the construction of his identity, the play delves into the consequences of a life driven by aspiration and revenge.  The opening of \"Catilina\" introduces the titular character in a moment of deep reflection and turmoil. Standing on a hill outside of Rome, he expresses a discontent with his life filled with \"unleashed pleasures\" and a longing for purpose, fueled by the societal decay he perceives in Rome. As he encounters representatives from the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe, he warns them against seeking refuge in Rome, asserting that tyranny and injustice reign in the city. Throughout these interactions, Catilina struggles with his internal demons and the weight of his aspirations, setting the stage for a dramatic exploration of his character and the ensuing conflict with both his personal ambitions and external adversaries.
