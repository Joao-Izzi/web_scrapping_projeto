    "resumo": "\"Overdue: The Story of a Missing Ship\" by Harry Collingwood is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story revolves around a young midshipman, Philip Troubridge, who unexpectedly takes command of the ship Mercury after its crew suffers a series of disastrous accidents, leaving them without a navigator. The book captures the spirit of adventure on the high seas, with a focus on maritime life and the challenges faced by its characters.  The opening of the novel introduces us to the midshipman aboard the Salamis, a full-rigged clipper ship on its journey to Melbourne. As they navigate the ocean, a tragic accident leads to the loss of the second mate, which sets the stage for Philip's subsequent transfer to the Mercury. Here, he discovers that the ship and her crew, consisting of illiterate sailors, are in dire straits due to the absence of capable leadership. As tensions rise, the challenges of navigating this unfamiliar vessel become a matter of life and death, laying the groundwork for the unfolding drama of survival and the unexpected adventures that await them at sea.
