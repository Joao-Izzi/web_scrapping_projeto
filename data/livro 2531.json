    "resumo": "\"Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition: A History\" by Rafael Sabatini is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the establishment and evolution of the Spanish Inquisition, focusing particularly on the figure of Frey Tómas de Torquemada, exploring the significance of his actions within the broader context of religious fanaticism and persecution in Spain. The book examines how Torquemada's relentless pursuit of religious conformity shaped the tumultuous history of the Inquisition, leaving a lasting impact on Spanish society.  The opening of the text sets the stage for a detailed exploration of its central themes by presenting Torquemada not just as an individual, but as an embodiment of the oppressive forces of religious zealotry that characterized the era. It discusses the Inquisition's emergence from earlier persecutions, framing it as a formidable institution that wielded both religious and secular powers to enforce orthodoxy. Sabatini emphasizes the tragic irony of a faith rooted in love and compassion morphing into a system of ruthless intolerance, inviting readers to reflect on the historical dynamics between authority, belief, and humanity's darker impulses as the narrative unfolds.
