    "resumo": "\"Early English Water-Colour Drawings of the Great Masters\" by A. J. Finberg is a collection of art criticism and exhibition catalogues written in the early 20th century. The text focuses primarily on the significant works of British artists who excelled in watercolour painting, particularly the renowned J.M.W. Turner, alongside discussions of his predecessors and contemporaries. The book aims to highlight the historical context of these artworks and promote a deeper appreciation of watercolour as a vital artistic medium.  The opening of this work serves as an introduction to the importance of Turner and his contributions to watercolour painting. It discusses a remarkable exhibition held in 1919 that featured a selection of Turner's creations along with pieces from other influential artists. Finberg articulates the public's appreciation for watercolours during a time when they were often overshadowed by oil painting, emphasizing the exhibition's role in educating and engaging the audience with Turner's masterpieces and the works of those who came before and alongside him. The introductory remarks set the stage for a detailed exploration of individual works, showcasing their technical mastery and the emotional resonance they carry.
