    "resumo": "\"Studies of Birds Killed in Nocturnal Migration\" by Harrison B. Tordoff and Robert M. Mengel is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. The work analyzes a collection of migrating birds that were killed by striking a television tower in Topeka, Kansas, during the autumn migration period of 1954. The authors explore various aspects of bird migration, including the environmental factors influencing these accidents and the implications for ornithological research.  The opening of the book details the context in which the study was conducted, setting the stage by highlighting the increasing dangers migrating birds face today with man-made structures like television towers. It introduces the significant mortality events associated with poor weather conditions and accidents, particularly during nocturnal migration. The authors also discuss the historical context of bird mortality studies, emphasizing the potential value of the data provided by such large-scale accidents in enhancing our understanding of bird migration patterns, sex and age differentials among species, and other important ecological insights.
