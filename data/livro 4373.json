    "resumo": "\"A Feast of Demons\" by William Morrison is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The narrative submerges readers into a world grappling with the consequences of a scientific discovery that alters the fabric of aging and rejuvenation. The plot intertwines themes of ambition, consequences of unchecked scientific exploration, and the chaotic balance of life and death.  The story follows Virgil Hampstead, who reconnects with his old college acquaintance, Theobald Greco, a brilliant but eccentric scientist embroiled in experiments involving Maxwell's demonsâ€”entities that manipulate the flow of energy and matter. As Virgie becomes entangled in Greco's world of transmutation and the pursuit of wealth, the situation spirals beyond their control, leading to catastrophic fires and the release of entities that can either age or rejuvenate individuals. As chaos unfolds across society, with people rapidly aging or becoming younger, the characters face moral and existential dilemmas. The narrative culminates in a world where life cycles become unstable and blurred, leaving readers to ponder the consequences of humanity's desire to conquer aging and mortality.
