    "resumo": "\"The Vanderlark\" by Margaret St. Clair is a science fiction novel written in the early 1950s. The story delves into the eerie and isolating nature of deep space, exploring the psychological and physical horrors faced by its characters as they encounter a mysterious entity known as the Vanderlark. Through its narrative, the book probes themes of desperation, fear of the unknown, and the consequences of human actions in unfamiliar realms.  The plot follows two characters, McFeen and Alice, who are on a perilous space journey while transporting Hyra, a biological organism intended to combat a blight on the planet Varro. Their mission takes a dark turn when the Hyra begin to breed uncontrollably in the unforgiving expanse of deep space, leading to the discovery of a shadowy presenceâ€”the Vanderlark. As they grapple with their deteriorating situation, the characters face not only the haunting reality of their spacecraft's condition but also the surreal and threatening nature of the Vanderlark itself.
