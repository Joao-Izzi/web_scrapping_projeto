    "resumo": "\"Out of Mulberry Street: Stories of Tenement Life in New York City\" by Jacob A. Riis is a collection of stories written in the late 19th century. It explores the harsh realities and vibrant lives of the impoverished residents in New York Cityâ€™s tenements, illustrating both their struggles and the moments of joy that punctuate their daily existence. The narratives aim to shine a light on the social conditions of the time, making the unseen visible to a broader audience.  The opening portion of the book introduces us to the atmosphere of the tenements during the Christmas season, capturing the poignant mix of hope and despair among the residents. It begins with the author reflecting on a single sprig of holly that stirs memories of the holiday season, leading into scenes of bustling streets full of holiday shoppers and the various families in their humble abodes. We meet families coping with poverty and celebrate the small joys of Christmas in their lives, such as the excitement over a simple Christmas tree adorned with makeshift ornaments. The juxtaposition of the festive spirit with the grim realities faced by these families sets the stage for a deeper exploration of their lives throughout the collection.
