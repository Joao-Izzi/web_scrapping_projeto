    "resumo": "\"The Kingdom of God, Part 1\" by Orson Pratt is a theological publication written in the mid-19th century. As one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Pratt presents a discourse centered on the nature of divine governance, positing that God's government is the only legitimate authority on Earth. The book delineates the characteristics of the Kingdom of God and the importance of being governed by divine laws as opposed to human concoctions.  In this text, Pratt argues extensively against established human governments, labeling them as unauthorized and rebellious against the divinity of God's Kingdom. He emphasizes the need for a theocracy governed by divine revelation and authority, detailing seven key subjects that readers must understand to comprehend the Kingdom's nature. Throughout the discourse, he critiques modern Christianity, challenging prevailing notions of God and advocating for the necessity of new revelation and ministers called by God to administer essential ordinances such as baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. The work ultimately advocates for a return to the divinely sanctioned governance of the Kingdom of God, providing insight into its structure, officers, and requirements for citizenship.
