    "resumo": "\"Fifty Famous Stories Retold\" by James Baldwin is a collection of classic tales, likely written in the late 19th century. This compilation presents a variety of well-known stories drawn from history, folklore, and legends, intended primarily for a younger audience to instill moral lessons and spark an interest in literature. The narratives revolve around significant figures and events, featuring characters such as King Alfred, Julius Caesar, and Robin Hood, each exemplifying bravery, wisdom, and virtue.  The opening portion of the book introduces its aim and scope, emphasizing the educational value and historical significance of the stories included. Baldwin describes the importance of familiarizing children with these tales to nurture their understanding of moral truths and cultural heritage. The initial stories presented feature King Alfred, showcasing his wisdom through two poignant episodes: one where he unknowingly burns the cakes while preoccupied with higher matters and another illustrating his compassion in sharing his last food with a beggar. These anecdotes set the tone for the collection, combining entertainment with valuable life lessons, thereby engaging young readers while enriching their knowledge of history and moral philosophy.
