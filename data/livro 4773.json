    "resumo": "\"Le dîner interrompu\" by Ernest Doin is a comedic farce written in the early 1870s, reflecting the theatrical styles of that period, particularly in France. This one-act play serves as a humorous sequel to Doin's previous work, \"Le Désespoir de Jocrisse.\" The story revolves around the themes of social class and domestic life, emphasizing the amusing antics and misunderstandings among the characters, particularly involving the character Jocrisse, who is a comedic domestic figure.  The plot centers on Jocrisse, Plumet, and their interactions with Vincent, an influential friend of Plumet. As Plumet prepares for his anniversary dinner, Jocrisse devises a scheme to secure an invitation to the meal, fearing that he and Laflûte might be relegated to eating leftovers. Through a series of comedic misunderstandings and a clever pretense about Plumet's supposed craving for ears—leading to panic about their safety—Doin crafts a playful narrative that showcases Jocrisse's wily charm and the absurdity of the situations that arise. Ultimately, the production balances both farcical humor and social commentary, ending with a communal acceptance of all characters at the dinner table. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
