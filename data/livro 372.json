    "resumo": "\"Questionable Shapes\" by William Dean Howells is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story opens with the protagonist, Hewson, grappling with the enigmatic experience of encountering an apparition, a phenomenon that leaves him both intrigued and deeply reflective about its implications in his life. The narrative seems to explore themes of reality versus perception and the human condition's response to the supernatural, as well as the interplay of social dynamics among a group of characters at a summer house party.  At the start of the book, Hewson wakes early in June, disturbed by his encounter with the apparition, and contemplates the significance of his unusual experience against the backdrop of a summer morning filled with birdsong and natural beauty. As he prepares for breakfast, there is a growing sense of his internal conflict regarding how to share this extraordinary event with his hosts and guests without feeling the need for validation. The opening chapters detail his interactions with St. John, the host, and other guests, particularly highlighting his interactions with the mysterious Miss Hernshaw, hinting at deeper connections that may evolve as the story progresses. Despite his initial excitement about sharing his experience, he ultimately decides against it due to the potential repercussions, setting the stage for the novel's exploration of truth, identity, and interpersonal relationships in the face of extraordinary occurrences.
