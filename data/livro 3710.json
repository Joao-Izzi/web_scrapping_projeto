    "resumo": "\"Curiosities of the American Stage\" by Laurence Hutton is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book delves into the intricacies of American theater, particularly exploring its lesser-known aspects and various notable performers. Through a series of chapters, Hutton aims to illuminate the rich and diverse history of plays and players in America, making it relevant to both dramatic collectors and avid theatergoers.  At the start of the work, the author reflects on the state of the American drama, asserting that an authentic American play has yet to be truly created. He discusses the cultural significance of homegrown theatrical expressions while lamenting the lack of original works that capture the essence of American life. Hutton introduces historical plays, such as the first American play \"The Contrast,\" and highlights influential figures on the stage, like actors and playwrights, leading to a discussion of various genres and themes, including the Indian drama and the Revolutionary and war plays. The complexity of American identity is intricately woven into its theatrical expression, setting the stage for a broader exploration of its evolution throughout the book.
