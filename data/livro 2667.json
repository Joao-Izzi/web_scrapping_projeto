    "resumo": "\"The Express Companies of the United States: A Study of a Public Utility\" by Bert Benedict is a scholarly analysis written during the early 20th century. This publication examines the history and development of express services in the United States, tracing their evolution from the early days of parcel delivery to their consolidation with major railroads and the effects of emerging competition from the parcel post system. The book likely addresses the economic implications of these developments, exploring the need for government regulation or ownership of express services.  In this detailed study, Benedict provides an overview of the express companies' rise and operations in the United States, focusing on companies such as Wells Fargo and American Express. He critiques the lack of government oversight prior to the early 1900s, highlighting the inefficiencies and high costs associated with private express firms. The book analyzes the competition between express companies and the parcel post, emphasizing the potential benefits of government ownership, such as reduced operational costs and improved public service. Benedict ultimately argues for a national express service managed by the government, advocating for policies that could enhance efficiency and increase accessibility for consumers, particularly in rural areas.
