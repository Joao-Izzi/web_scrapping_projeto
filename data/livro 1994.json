    "resumo": "\"Vadertje Langbeen\" by Jean Webster is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Jerusha Abbott, an orphan living in a foundling home, as she navigates the challenges of growing up and education while yearning for a life beyond the confines of the institution. The book highlights her imaginative spirit and her correspondence with an anonymous benefactor she affectionately names \"Daddy-Long-Legs.\"  The opening of the novel introduces readers to the dreariness of \"Lamme Woensdag,\" a day dreaded by the children at the orphanage due to the strict expectations placed upon them by the directrice. Jerusha Abbott, the main character, weaves through her responsibilities with a blend of determination and daydreaming about a life outside her current situation. She is tasked with caring for younger children and contemplates her future when the directrice reveals that a regent has decided to sponsor her university education based on her promising writing talent. This announcement leads Jerusha to begin corresponding with her mysterious benefactor, setting the stage for her journey of self-discovery and growth as she aspires to become a writer.
