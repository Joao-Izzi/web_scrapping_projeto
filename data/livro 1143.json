    "resumo": "\"Was heißt: sich im Denken orientieren?\" by Immanuel Kant is a philosophical treatise written in the late 18th century. This work delves into the nature of human reasoning, exploring how we orient ourselves in thought—particularly when navigating concepts that extend beyond empirical experience. Kant addresses the limitations and capabilities of human reason, especially in the context of moral and metaphysical inquiries.  In this text, Kant emphasizes the importance of \"orienting\" oneself within various realms of knowledge, particularly when direct experience is absent. He discusses how our understanding is often governed by subjective principles and the intrinsic need for coherence in our reasoning. Kant argues that while theoretical pursuits may stem from a need to explain the universe, practical reason compels us to consider the existence of a higher moral authority, such as God, as foundational to ethical living. Ultimately, the work serves as a guide for how one can responsibly navigate philosophical inquiries, balancing speculative thought with the rigor of moral imperatives, and highlighting the necessity of a sound framework for belief that aligns with human reason.
