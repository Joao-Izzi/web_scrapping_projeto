    "resumo": "\"Slow Burn\" by Henry Still is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century. Set against the backdrop of space exploration, it explores the tensions and challenges faced by a crew aboard a space station, particularly with political interference from Senator McKelvie, who threatens the success of a crucial lunar rocket launch. The narrative delves into themes of ambition, anxiety, and the unforeseen consequences of human actions in the realm of space travel.  The story follows Kevin Morrow, the commander of the space station, as he navigates the complexities of a critical mission to launch the \"Moonbeam\" rocket towards the moon. Tensions rise when the incompetent yet powerful Senator McKelvie arrives to oversee the operations, bringing with him an air of skepticism that jeopardizes the crew's morale. As the launch unfolds, an unexpected disaster occurs, resulting in the space station being pulled off course, placing the lives of the crew in grave danger. With quick thinking and a race against time, Morrow and his team must devise a plan to stabilize the station and ensure their survival, all while dealing with the repercussions of McKelvie's meddling. The climax showcases the ingenuity and resilience of the crew as they confront obstacles that test their limits in the harshness of space. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
