    "resumo": "\"Harper's Young People, February 14, 1882\" by Various is a collection of children's literature published in the late 19th century. The volume includes engaging stories, poems, and articles designed to entertain and educate young readers. One of the featured narratives revolves around the lives of two girls, Electa Eliza and Theodora Judson, exploring themes of kindness, friendship, and the pursuit of meaningful missions through acts of charity.  At the start of this edition, readers are introduced to Electa Eliza, a compassionate twelve-year-old girl who dedicates her time to caring for her baby brother while her mother works. In contrast, Theodora enjoys a life of privilege yet yearns for purpose and significance in her own endeavors. Their paths converge when Theodora receives a heartfelt 'valentine' from Electa seeking assistance, which prompts Theodora to consider her own potential to make a difference in the world. This touching opening sets the tone for a narrative that emphasizes empathy, selflessness, and the profound impact one individual can have on another's life.
