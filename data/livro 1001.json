    "resumo": "\"A History of Germany from the Earliest Times to the Present Day\" by Bayard Taylor is a comprehensive historical account written in the late 19th century. This work offers a detailed narrative of German history, covering its development from ancient times through to the late 19th century, including the complexities and connections of various tribes and nations that contributed to what would become modern Germany.   At the start of the book, the author sets the stage by discussing the origins of the Germanic tribes and their migration, outlining the characteristics, lifestyle, and social structure of the ancient Germans. He describes their interactions with surrounding cultures, particularly the Roman Empire, and the significant conflicts that arose, such as the battles between the Romans and the Germanic tribes. The opening portion provides a foundation for understanding the historical context in which these tribes existed, their values, their religious practices, and the political dynamics that led to critical turns in their history.
