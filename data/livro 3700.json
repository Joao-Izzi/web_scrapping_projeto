    "resumo": "\"Aili\" by Matti Kurikka is a dramatic play written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the character Aili, the daughter of Mrs. Hartin, and her experiences and struggles with the restrictions imposed by her upbringing and societal expectations. The story unfolds in a modern setting in Helsinki, where Aili contemplates her future, her education, and her desires, often caught between the traditional views held by her mother and the more progressive thoughts that her friend Helli represents.  At the start of \"Aili,\" the audience is introduced to various characters in a lavish salon that leads to a beautiful garden, setting the stage for the interactions that explore themes of freedom, societal norms, and female identity. Aili is depicted as a young woman yearning for independence and self-discovery, expressing her frustration at being treated like a child while navigating her budding romantic feelings for her fiancé, Vilhelm Ahrén. The dialogue reveals Aili's conflicting emotions and insights about her constraints, as her friends and acquaintances discuss modern ideas and the life of women in society, foreshadowing the broader discussions about women's rights and social change that will unfold throughout the play.
