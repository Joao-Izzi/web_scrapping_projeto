    "resumo": "\"Rautatie\" by Juhani Aho is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds in a rural Finnish setting, following the lives of an older couple, Matti and Liisa, as they navigate the impact of modernity—in this case, the advent of the railway—on their simple, traditional way of life. The narrative explores themes of change, progress, and the emotional landscape of rural inhabitants faced with new technologies and societal shifts.  The opening of the novel sets a vivid and wintry scene, describing the chill of the air and the everyday activities around the couple's homestead. We meet Matti as he reflects on the past while engaging in the mundane tasks of rural life, interspersed with humorous exchanges with the local priest and the peasant Ville regarding the recently completed railway. Through conversations and mundane interactions, we see Matti's bewilderment about the new railway, illustrating both his skepticism and curiosity. The stage is set for an exploration of how the railway will affect their lives and community, establishing a rich backdrop for the unfolding story focused on human experience amidst technological change.
