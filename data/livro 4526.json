    "resumo": "\"The Halo\" by Bettina von Hutten is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds through the lives of various characters, including the eccentric Earl of Kingsmead, his charming sister Brigit, and the talented violinist Victor Joyselle, who becomes entangled in their lives. The novel explores themes of music, love, and the complexities of social class, focusing on how these elements intertwine and influence the characters' relationships.  The opening of the book introduces us to a rural Norman setting, where an old, blind fiddler plays a discordant tune under an apple tree, accompanied by his loyal dog, Papillon. Soon, a fiery young boy named Victor-Marie Joyselle confronts the fiddler, unable to bear the horrible noise. This interaction leads to a moment of connection between the characters as the old man plays a beautiful melody, revealing the shared emotional depth in their disparate lives. We are then transported to the world of the Earl of Kingsmead, who is curiously inquisitive about the people and things around him, setting the stage for the novelâ€™s exploration of human connections through music and personal experiences.
