    "resumo": "\"Le Conscrit ou Le Retour de Crimée\" by Ernest Doin is a comedic drama in two acts written during the mid-19th century. This play explores the themes of military conscription and camaraderie among soldiers, set against the backdrop of the Crimean War. The story revolves around young conscripts from a village as they face the harsh realities of being called to serve their country.  The narrative centers on characters like Criquet, a fearful conscript who is initially distraught over being drafted, and Robert and Julien, who exhibit a mixture of bravado and genuine patriotism. The first act sets the stage with lively interactions among village locals as they prepare to bid farewell to the conscripts.
