    "resumo": "\"The Princess Elopes\" by Harold MacGrath is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story introduces readers to the spirited Princess Hildegarde of Barscheit, a young woman defying the constraints of her royal position and the expectations of a politically arranged marriage to the Prince of Doppelkinn. As Hildegarde grapples with the desires for love and freedom, the narrative promises the tensions and romances of royal life intertwined with a satirical reflection on society.  At the start of the novel, the narrator sets the stage in the Grand Duchy of Barscheit, highlighting its stark contrast between modern conveniences and archaic laws. The grand duke wishes Princess Hildegarde to marry Prince Doppelkinn, yet Hildegarde is determined to find true love on her own terms, rejecting suitors and rebelling against her uncleâ€™s desires. Her education in England has fostered a strong spirit and desire for independence, prompting her to concoct a plan to escape her impending marriage. This opening lays the groundwork for a tale filled with mischief, adventure, and romance as the princess navigates her societal constraints. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
