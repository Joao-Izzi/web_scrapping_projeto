    "resumo": "\"Hiên le Maboul\" by Émile Nolly is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Hiên, a soldier of second class belonging to the 11th company of the 1st regiment of Annamite tirailleurs, who experiences profound struggles with his identity and place within military life, set against the backdrop of Cochinchina. His journey is marked by a mix of societal expectations, personal limitations, and a yearning for connection, particularly as he navigates relationships and the trauma of warfare.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to Hiên as he contemplates the darkness around him, reflecting on his past as a simple, often mocked figure in his village. He faces the reality of military life, feeling lost and overwhelmed by the soldiers' bureaucracy and brutality, particularly under the watch of the cruel adjudant Pietro. Hiên's ongoing internal battle manifests through his interactions with his fellow soldiers and especially with Maÿ, a girl who represents both his attraction and his insecurities. The opening chapters set the tone for a poignant exploration of isolation, the quest for acceptance, and the struggle against the constraints of societal expectations.
