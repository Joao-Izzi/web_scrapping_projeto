    "resumo": "\"The Quest for the Rose of Sharon\" by Burton Egbert Stevenson is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around a young girl named Cecil Truman, who faces the challenges of her family's sudden loss and her eccentric grandaunt, Nelson. With the promise of uncovering a hidden treasure left behind by her grandaunt through a mysterious verse, Cecil embarks on a quest that intertwines her family's legacy with themes of duty and resilience.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Cecil and her family as they grapple with the death of her father, which leads to the arrival of grandaunt Nelsonâ€”a strict and controlling relative. Grandaunt Nelson's overbearing nature complicates their already difficult circumstances, setting the stage for both conflict and growth. Cecil's longing for adventure and her determination to solve the riddle left by her grandaunt act as a catalyst for the story, as she navigates her new home, meets new friends, and seeks to uncover the secrets of the Rose of Sharon that guards the treasure.
