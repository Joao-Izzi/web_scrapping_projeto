    "resumo": "\"Kaleri-orja: Kertomus rahvaan perheille\" by Heinrich Zschokke is a novel written in the mid-19th century, likely during the 1860s. The book delves into the themes of morality, sin, and redemption through the tale of Leonardo, a young man whose negligence towards his family leads him down a dark path, culminating in tragedy and despair.  The narrative follows Leonardo, who becomes increasingly disconnected from his responsibilities as a husband and father due to a reckless lifestyle filled with hunting and bad company. His life spirals out of control after he accidentally kills a forest officer during a confrontation. Riddled with guilt, he faces the repercussions of his actions both legally and personally, causing suffering to his wife, Sabina, and their children who are left in poverty. The story explores the tension between familial obligations and personal desires, culminating in Leonardo's path to redemption when he sacrifices his freedom to save others, specifically through the benevolent act of Vincent de Paula, who chooses to take Leonardoâ€™s place in servitude. Thus, the book weaves a tale that starkly examines the consequences of sin and the possibility of forgiveness and moral recovery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
