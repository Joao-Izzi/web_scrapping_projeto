    "resumo": "\"Tales and Novels of J. de La Fontaine — Volume 19\" by Jean de La Fontaine is a collection of fables and narratives written in the 17th century, specifically during the early modern period. This volume primarily explores themes of love, folly, and the intricacies of human behavior through humorous and satirical tales. The stories within reflect La Fontaine's insightful social commentary on the nature of relationships and personal dilemmas, rendered with wit and charm.  The book contains two main tales: \"The Psalter\" and \"King Candaules and the Doctor of Laws.\" In \"The Psalter,\" a charming youth's romantic escapade with a beautiful nun named Isabella leads to comical misunderstandings within a convent, highlighting the often hypocritical nature of religious life and the tensions between desire and duty. Meanwhile, \"King Candaules and the Doctor of Laws\" recounts the folly of King Candaules, who invites his vassal Gyges to see his queen undressed, resulting in jealousy, betrayal, and ultimately, tragedy as Candaules loses both his throne and his life. Together, these tales exemplify La Fontaine's deft storytelling and his ability to weave moral lessons into engaging narratives. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
