    "resumo": "\"Prisoners Their Own Warders\" by Major J. R. A. McNair is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work documents the convict prison system at Singapore, detailing its establishment in 1825 and subsequent operations until its closure in 1873, while also providing insights into related convict establishments at Bencoolen, Penang, and Malacca. The author delves into the management, treatment, and contributions of Indian convicts within this penal system, exploring themes of punishment, industry, and rehabilitation.  At the start of the book, the authors express their motivation for writing this account, acknowledging the historical significance of the convict system in Singapore and the potential lessons it offers for contemporary penal practices. They provide a brief overview of the convict origins from Bencoolen and the systematic categorization and treatment methods introduced by notable figures within the administration. The opening portion sets the foundation for a detailed examination of the convict establishmentâ€™s contributions to public works, the evolution of management practices over the years, and the broader implications for convict labor within colonial contexts.
