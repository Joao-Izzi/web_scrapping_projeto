    "resumo": "\"Puphejmo: Dramo en tri aktoj\" by Henrik Ibsen is a play written in the late 19th century. This significant work revolves around the characters Nora and Torvald Helmer as they navigate complex themes of marriage, societal roles, and personal independence during a time when gender norms were heavily enforced. The play delves into Nora's struggles for self-identity and freedom within the confines of her domestic life.  At the start of the play, the setting is described as a cozy yet modestly furnished living room in the Helmer household, on Christmas Eve. Nora is introduced as a lively and somewhat carefree character, interacting affectionately with her husband, Torvald, who has just received a promotion that promises a more prosperous future for the family. As the act unfolds, we learn that while Nora indulges in shopping and preparations for the festive season, her past actions hint at deeper tensions. It is revealed that Nora secretly borrowed a large sum of money against her father's name to save Torvaldâ€™s life years earlier, setting the stage for forthcoming conflicts surrounding secrets, societal expectations, and personal sacrifice.
