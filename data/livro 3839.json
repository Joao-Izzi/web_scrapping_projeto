    "resumo": "\"Tales from the Arabic — Complete\" by John Payne is a rich collection of stories likely derived from \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night,\" compiled in the late 19th century. This compilation includes tales that have been retold across generations, steeped in the culture of the Middle East. The narrative is woven through various characters, notably a young merchant named Aboulhusn el Khelia, who experiences a dramatic journey full of wit, adventure, and the social commentary of friendship and wealth.  The opening of this compilation introduces us to Aboulhusn, who, after squandering his inheritance on frivolous company, finds himself abandoned by friends in his time of need. Grievously let down, he swears to entertain only strangers henceforth. His fortunes take a turn when he encounters the disguised Khalif Haroun er Reshid, who, under the guise of a merchant, becomes Aboulhusn's guest for a night of revelry. As the tale unfolds, it humorously explores themes of identity, companionship, and the transitory nature of wealth, culminating in a series of comical misunderstandings that illustrate the folly of human nature. As the Khalif takes joy in Aboulhusn’s cleverness and hospitality, their encounter sets the stage for many more intriguing tales in the collection. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
