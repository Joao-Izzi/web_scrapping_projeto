    "resumo": "\"Cancer: Its Cause and Treatment, Volume 2\" by Lucius Duncan Bulkley is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This detailed work examines the nature of cancer, arguing for its treatment as a medical rather than a purely surgical condition. Bulkley seeks to address the rising mortality rates associated with cancer and proposes a more integrative approach to its understanding and management.  The opening of the volume presents the author's perspective on cancer, contrasting traditional surgical methods with his medical observations and studies. He discusses the alarming increase in cancer mortality rates despite advances in surgical treatment and emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the disease's underlying causes. Bulkley shares reflections on clinical practices, noting the significance of diet and lifestyle in managing cancer while asserting that successful treatment relies on addressing systemic issues rather than merely excising tumors. Throughout this introduction, Bulkley sets the stage for a series of lectures that promise to explore cancer more thoroughly through clinical observation and research, offering readers a holistic view of the disease.
