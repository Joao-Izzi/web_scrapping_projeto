    "resumo": "\"A Question of Courage\" by Jesse F. Bone is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The book revolves around the tensions of command and morale aboard a Navy scout ship during a prolonged conflict in space, focusing on the experiences of Lieutenant Thomas Marsden as he navigates the challenges posed by a rigid commanding officer and the psychological toll of war. The story deeply explores themes of duty, leadership, and the fine line between cowardice and courage in times of conflict.  In the narrative, Lieutenant Marsden joins the crew of the \"Lachesis,\" a scout ship under the command of the infamous Commander Charles Augustus Chase, whom Marsden suspects lacks the fortitude necessary for leadership. As they prepare for an offensive mission against enemy forces, Marsden witnesses the crew's frustration and low morale stemming from Chase's strict adherence to protocol and his fear of combat. When a critical engagement with the enemy unfolds, Chase takes extreme measures to save the crew and secure victory, ultimately sacrificing himself in a heroic act that redefines Marsden's understanding of courage. The story culminates in a reflection on the price of survival and the complex nature of bravery, leaving readers with profound insights into human resilience in the face of adversity.
