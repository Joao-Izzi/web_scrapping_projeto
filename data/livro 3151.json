    "resumo": "\"Common Names of a Selected List of Plants\" by Kling L. Anderson and Clenton E. Owensby is a technical publication written in the late 20th century. This work focuses on the common names of various plant species, addressing the inconsistencies and variations that exist in plant nomenclature across different regions. The authors aim to create a standardized list that aids in effective communication about plant species, especially for agricultural and educational purposes.  The opening of this technical bulletin sets the stage by discussing the challenges of using common names for plants, which often lead to confusion and miscommunication. It emphasizes the necessity of scientific names for accurately identifying species, especially in formal contexts. The authors explain their goal of establishing standardized common names for selected plants found in Kansas and lay out their methodology for selecting and naming the plants included in the list, illustrating their commitment to clarity and uniformity in plant nomenclature.
