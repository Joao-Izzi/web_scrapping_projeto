    "resumo": "\"This is Klon Calling\" by Walter J. Sheldon is a science fiction short story published in the early 1950s. The narrative is centered around Professor Lyman Dane, an eccentric scientist known for his humorous teaching style, who finds himself caught in a bizarre situation involving an FBI investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). As Dane navigates his surreal circumstances, the story explores themes of humor in academia, curiosity about extraterrestrial life, and the intricacies of human interactions with authority.  In the story, Professor Dane's practical joking nature leads him to prank his colleague, Dr. Wallace Fincher, by pretending to be an alien commander communicating about potential threats to their home planet from Earth. His joke takes a sudden and dark turn when Fincher appears in person with unexpected intentions. The narrative humorously contrasts Dane's light-hearted antics against the serious undertones of governmental surveillance and the tension surrounding the era's fascination with space and extraterrestrial contact. Ultimately, this story encapsulates a playful examination of intelligence, authority, and the absurdity that can arise from misunderstanding the unknown.
