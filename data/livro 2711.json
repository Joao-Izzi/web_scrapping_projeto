    "resumo": "\"The Hollow Tree Snowed-in Book\" by Albert Bigelow Paine is a charming children's book likely written in the early 20th century. This delightful work serves as a continuation of the stories featuring the whimsical Hollow Tree People and their adventures in the Big Deep Woods. The narrative is infused with the themes of friendship, storytelling, and the magic of the winter season, inviting young readers into a cozy world filled with animal characters like Mr. Dog, Mr. Coon, and Mr. Possum, who enjoy good times around their hollow tree.  The opening of this enchanting tale introduces readers to the setting of the Hollow Tree and establishes a sense of nostalgia as the Story Teller prepares to recount tales to the Little Lady. It begins with a reflection on the journey of the Hollow Tree People as they gather inside for the winter festivities, having been snowed in. The Story Teller lights his pipe and begins the first of many engaging stories, setting the stage for warmth and companionship while the snow blankets the world outside. As the characters prepare for their time together, the excitement builds around Christmas, filled with delightful discussions about \"menageries\" and the adventures that await, preparing the reader for an imaginative exploration of the joys and challenges of these beloved woodland creatures.
