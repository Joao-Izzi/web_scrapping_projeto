    "resumo": "\"The Runaway Asteroid\" by Michael D. Cooper is a science fiction novel written in the early 21st century. The story is set in a futuristic universe where space travel is commonplace, and it follows a group of characters, particularly focusing on the Starman, David \"Zip\" Foster, as they navigate the dangers presented by renegade pirates led by Lurton Zimbardo after a failed coup on Mars.  The beginning of the novel sets a tense scene aboard the pirate ship \"Silver Spear\", where Lurton Zimbardo is desperately trying to evade capture after a recent failed coup attempt on Mars. As Zimbardo and his crew work to escape into the Asteroid Belt, the pursuit is joined by Zip Foster and his companions, who aim to thwart Zimbardo and restore order. This section introduces key elements such as the pirates' ambitions, the advanced technology of their ships and asteroids, as well as the growing tension between the Starmen and the remnants of the pirate crew. The narrative rapidly develops from this chase, establishing a strong sense of urgency while hinting at deeper themes of loyalty, leadership, and the consequences of power struggles in a richly painted, interstellar backdrop.
