Tunnell is a scientific publication written in the late 20th century.

The opening of the report introduces the background and context for the excavation of the Harroun site. It explains the site's location, the collaborative effort between The University of Texas and the National Park Service, and outlines the excavation process carried out between 1957 and 1959. Initial findings revealed multiple mounds, burial features, and artifacts related to the Fulton Aspect of the Caddoan Area, indicating the site's importance for understanding the region's archaeological history. The opening emphasizes the rigorous methods of excavation and recording, which set the stage for the detailed analysis to follow in the subsequent chapters.
