    "resumo": "\"Peregrine in France: A Lounger's Journal, in Familiar Letters to His Friend\" is a collection of letters written in the early 19th century. The narrative centers around the character Peregrine as he embarks on a journey through France, sharing his observations and experiences with a friend back home. The book appears to explore themes of travel, culture, and personal reflection during a period of significant historical transition in Europe.  The opening of the work introduces us to Peregrine shortly after his arrival in Paris. He reassures his anxious friend about his safe journey and acknowledges the trials of traveling during the winter months. The letters begin with vivid descriptions of his encounters, from the tumult of finding accommodations and the amusing honesty of a French servant to the architectural marvels and cultural landmarks he visits in Boulogne and Paris. Through his correspondence, Peregrine also reflects on the contrasts between English and French customs, the effects of war on the landscape, and his appreciation for the subtleties of French life as he lounges and leisurely observes the world around him.
