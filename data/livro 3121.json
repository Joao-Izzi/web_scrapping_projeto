    "resumo": "\"The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero, Volume 4\" by Marcus Tullius Cicero is a historical collection of speeches from the Roman statesman and orator, likely written in the late Roman Republic era. This volume primarily consists of the Philippics, a series of fourteen orations Cicero delivered against Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony) in response to Antonius's actions following the assassination of Julius Caesar. Through his speeches, Cicero addresses pressing political issues, critiques the actions of his rivals, and defends the stability of the Roman Republic.  At the start of this volume, Cicero outlines the political turmoil following Caesar's death, detailing how Antonius maneuvered to consolidate power and manipulate the Senate. He describes the fear and chaos in Rome, emphasizing the necessity of his own return to the political arena to combat Antonius's increasingly dictatorial behavior. The opening primarily sets the scene of a divided Rome, where Cicero feels compelled to assert his authority and defend the republic against perceived threats posed by Antonius, framing his speeches as a desperate plea for the preservation of republican ideals and governance.
