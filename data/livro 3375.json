    "resumo": "\"Mi tío y mi cura\" by Jean de La Brète is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story seems to revolve around the life of a young girl, Reina, who is growing up in a challenging household ruled by her harsh aunt and the kind-hearted village priest. As Reina navigates her childhood, she grapples with themes of authority, education, and her burgeoning independence, all while showcasing her wit and youthful defiance.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Reina, who describes herself as quite small, leading to her struggles with self-image and her relationship with her tall, unpleasant aunt. After her parents die, Reina is taken in by her aunt, who only agrees to raise her for the sake of financial gain. The opening sets a light-hearted yet poignant tone, highlighting Reina's mischievous personality, her contentious but affectionate relationship with the priest who educates her, and her quiet rebellion against her aunt's oppressive authority. The stage is set for a tale of growth, self-discovery, and the tension between individuality and social expectations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
