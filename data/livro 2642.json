    "resumo": "\"Blood Royal: A Novel\" by Grant Allen is a historical fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The story takes place in a picturesque English town named Chiddingwick and follows the lives of the Plantagenet family, particularly focusing on young Richard Plantagenet, who grapples with his noble lineage and aspirations for a better life. The narrative explores themes of social class, ambition, and romance against the backdrop of a declining family legacy.  The opening of the novel introduces Chiddingwick's quaint charm and offers a glimpse into the characters, notably Mr. Edmund Plantagenet and his son Richard. Mr. Plantagenet is portrayed as a pompous man clinging to his noble bloodline while struggling with the reality of his diminished circumstances, including his current role as a dancing instructor. Meanwhile, Richard is depicted as earnest and ambitious, longing to pursue higher education at Oxford to elevate his family's status. The chance encounter between Richard and Miss Mary Tudor, the new governess, sets the stage for a potential romantic subplot. This initial section establishes the social dynamics and aspirations that will unfold throughout the story, suggesting a blend of drama and intrigue as the characters navigate their complex identities and societal expectations.
