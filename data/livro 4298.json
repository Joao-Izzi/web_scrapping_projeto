    "resumo": "\"Virginibus Puerisque, and Other Papers\" by Robert Louis Stevenson is a collection of essays written during the late 19th century. This work explores various themes surrounding youth, friendship, marriage, and the complexities of human emotions and relationships. Through Stevenson's reflective and often humorous prose, readers are invited to contemplate societal conventions and personal experiences related to love and companionship.  The opening portion of the work delves deeply into the topic of marriage, contrasting the attitudes of Shakespeareâ€™s time with modern perspectives on matrimony. Stevenson examines the fears and uncertainties modern individuals face regarding marriage, likening it to a fear of death. He discusses the precarious nature of friendships and the social pressures surrounding marriage, ultimately reflecting on the compromises and challenges that come with intimate relationships. By analyzing couples, their choices, and the peculiar sentimentality that surrounds love, the beginning of the collection effectively sets the stage for a broader philosophical discussion on the nature of human connections.
