    "resumo": "\"Salome's Burden, or the Shadow on the Homes\" by Eleanora H. Stooke is a novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story centers on a fourteen-year-old girl named Salome Petherick, who is crippled and lives in a small village in Cornwall with her father, Josiah. The narrative explores themes of familial struggle, as Salome endures her father's descent into alcoholism while striving to maintain her home and garden.   The beginning of the novel introduces Salome as a kind and resilient character, who, despite her disability, endeavors to care for her father and manage their household. Set against the backdrop of a picturesque fishing village, the opening chapters outline Salome's internal conflicts fueled by her father's increasing dependence on drink and their societal struggles. As she navigates her painful reality, discussions with the local vicar and her budding interactions with a new wealthy family in town hint at the complex dynamics of social class, morality, and personal sacrifice that will likely unfold throughout the story.
