    "resumo": "\"Noteworthy Families (Modern Science)\" by Francis Galton and Edgar Schuster is a scientific publication likely written in the early 20th century. This work investigates kinship among distinguished individuals, particularly focusing on the families of noteworthy persons recognized for their contributions to science and society. It serves as a detailed index aimed at highlighting familial connections that have led to significant achievements, shedding light on the role of heredity in success.  The opening of the publication introduces its purpose, which is to systematically document and index families that have produced several notable individuals. Galton explains the methodology used to gather data, primarily through responses from Fellows of the Royal Society, and notes the challenges encountered in acquiring complete information. The authors emphasize the importance of kinship in producing noteworthy individuals and discuss various aspects of noteworthiness as a measure of ability.
