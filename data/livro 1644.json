    "resumo": "\"The Pastor's Wife\" by Elizabeth Von Arnim is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Ingeborg, the daughter of a bishop, who finds herself yearning for freedom and adventure outside the confines of her structured life. Following a dental visit, she embraces the exhilaration of solitude in London, which leads her to impulsively join an excursion to Switzerland, where her life takes an unexpected turn.  At the start of the book, Ingeborg experiences a vivid awakening to life beyond her duties as her father's assistant. Fresh from a tooth extraction, she is filled with elation and a sense of possibility, free from the burdens of her familial expectations. This leads her to the thrilling decision to join an excursion that will transform her mundane existence. During the trip, she encounters Herr Dremmel, a German pastor, with whom conversations about life, duty, and love unfold. This initial encounters give way to a deeper connection, culminating in an unexpected proposal that introduces tension between personal desires and familial obligations, setting the stage for a story about self-discovery, the constraints of societal norms, and the complexities of romantic relationships.
