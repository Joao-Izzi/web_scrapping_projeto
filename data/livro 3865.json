    "resumo": "\"De Bello Catilinario Et Jugurthino\" by Sallust is a historical account written in the late 1st century BC. The work intricately details two significant conflicts in Roman history: the Catilinarian conspiracy, which aimed to overthrow the Roman Republic, and the Jugurthine War, focusing on Jugurtha's resistance against Rome. Sallust, a political figure and historian, provides deep insights into the moral decay of Roman society during his time, highlighting themes of corruption and the struggle between different political factions.  At the start of the text, the author introduces himself and his motives for documenting the events of the Catilinarian conspiracy. Sallust discusses the nature of human ambition, contrasting the virtues of the Roman Republic with the vices that led to its decline. He begins by describing Lucius Catilina, the central figure behind the conspiracy, portraying him as a man of ambition and depravity. Sallust goes on to outline the social and political tensions in Rome, illustrating how Catiline capitalized on the prevailing discontent among the populace and his connections with disillusioned individuals, thus setting the stage for the dramatic events that would unfold in the conspiracy against the state. The opening thus establishes a tone of urgency and foreboding, inviting readers into a world of political intrigue and moral complexity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
