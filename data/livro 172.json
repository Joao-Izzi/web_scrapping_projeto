    "resumo": "\"Cavity-Nesting Birds of North American Forests\" by Virgil E. Scott, Keith E. Evans, David R. Patton, and Charles P. Stone is a scientific publication written in the late 20th century. This handbook provides an in-depth examination of 85 species of cavity-nesting birds, detailing their habitat needs, nesting behaviors, and dietary preferences. It serves as a crucial resource for wildlife research biologists and forest managers aiming to protect and manage the ecology of North American forests.  The opening of the handbook discusses the decline of cavity-nesting bird populations due to habitat loss, particularly the detrimental effects of intensive tree removal. It highlights the importance of dead or decaying trees (snags) for providing nesting sites, illustrating the ecological benefits of these birds in controlling destructive forest insects. The authors emphasize the need for further research into the specific habitat requirements of these species and advocate for forest management practices that recognize the value of retaining snags to support biodiversity and ecosystem health.
