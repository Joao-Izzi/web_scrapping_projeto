    "resumo": "\"The Roman Question\" by Edmond About is a historical account written in the mid-19th century that delves deeply into the political and social tensions surrounding the Papal States and the authority of the Pope during a time of great upheaval in Italy. The book critically examines the structure of the Papal government, the grievances of its subjects, and the paradoxes inherent in the Pope's dual role as a spiritual leader and a temporal ruler, drawing from various personal observations and contemporary analyses.  The opening of the text serves as a preface, outlining the author's extensive research and motivations for writing this work. The author reveals his initial impressions and the challenges he faced while compiling his thoughts amidst political contention, particularly the backlash from the Pontifical government. He introduces his focus on the seemingly oppressive rule of the Pope, whose absolute power generates unrest among the subjects who yearn for reform and better governance. This section effectively sets the stage for exploring the complexities of the Roman political landscape, highlighting the dissatisfaction among clergy and laypeople alike regarding the governance of the Papal States, and foreshadowing further discussions on class struggles, societal issues, and the necessary independence of the Pope from secular power.
