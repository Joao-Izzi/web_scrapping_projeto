    "resumo": "\"La corde au cou\" by Émile Gaboriau is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story appears to revolve around an intense mystery involving a fire at the Valpinson estate and the attempted murder of its owner, the Comte de Claudieuse. Key characters include the mayor, Monsieur Séneschal, and Monsieur de Claudieuse, alongside the enigmatic Cocoleu, who may play a pivotal role in unraveling the events.  At the start of the narrative, a frantic horseman disrupts the quiet of the night, alerting the mayor about a severe fire at the Valpinson estate. This incident is accompanied by the revelation of an assassination attempt on the count, raising the stakes significantly. As locals rush to respond to the crisis, the background of the characters and their relationships surface, notably the tension between the count and Monsieur de Boiscoran, who becomes embroiled in the subsequent investigation. As the scene unfolds, the opening provides a dramatic backdrop of urgency and suspense, setting the stage for a complex interplay of crime, community dynamics, and investigation.
