    "resumo": "\"Jacopo Ortisin Viimeiset Kirjeet\" by Ugo Foscolo is a novel written in the early 19th century. The narrative is centered around the character Jacopo Ortis, whose life unfolds against the backdrop of Italy's political turmoil and personal heartache. Through a series of letters, it explores themes of love, loss, and national identity, reflecting Foscolo's own deep connections to Italy and its struggles.  The opening of the novel sets the introspective tone as Jacopo Ortis grapples with his despair over Italy's political situation. He writes to his friend Lorenzo, sharing his feelings of alienation and reflecting on the state of his homeland, which has suffered under foreign rule. Jacopo expresses a haunting sense of hopelessness and a profound longing for freedom, while also revealing his emotional turmoil regarding love and personal relationships, particularly his affection for Teresa, who is engaged to another man. This early glimpse into his thoughts introduces readers to the passionate and contemplative nature of the protagonist along with the overarching themes of the novel, establishing a rich emotional landscape that invites further exploration.
