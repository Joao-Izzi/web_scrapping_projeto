    "resumo": "\"Yankee Girls in Zulu Land\" by Louise Vescelius Sheldon is a travel narrative written in the late 19th century. The book chronicles the experiences of American sisters who embark on a journey to South Africa for health and adventure, set against a backdrop of vibrant descriptions and cultural encounters. It offers insights into both their personal journey and the broader context of life during this period in South Africa, particularly concerning the interactions with various communities, including the indigenous Zulu people.  The opening of the narrative introduces the voyage of the three sisters—Louise, Eva, and their sickly sibling Frank—who are leaving behind the dreary London winter for the warmth of South Africa. Their decision is influenced by a physician's recommendation and colorful tales from an African woman about the beauty and wealth of the land. As they set sail aboard the Trojan, chaos ensues when Louise realizes she has left her diary behind, prompting a frantic cab ride back to retrieve it just before the ship departs. The text sets the stage for an exploration of different cultures, landscapes, and the experiences that will unfold as the sisters journey deeper into the region filled with Zulus and missionaries.
