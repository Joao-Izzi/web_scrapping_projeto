The volume focuses on the latter stages of the Seven Years' War, particularly from April 25, 1760, to February 15, 1763, detailing the efforts and strategies of Frederick the Great of Prussia as he navigates through dire military challenges and political intrigues. The narrative portrays the struggles of Friedrich amidst significant adversity, emphasizing his military tactics and the pivotal moments of his leadership during this critical campaign.

As the narrative unfolds, it highlights Friedrich's innovative maneuvers and military prowess, particularly in his marches that confound his enemies. The focus on Friedrich's specific military engagements, his anxious strategies, and correspondence with his commanders during the unfolding conflict sets the stage for a gripping account of his leadership, ambition, and the broader impact of the war on Prussia and its enemies.
