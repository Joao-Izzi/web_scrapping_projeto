    "resumo": "\"The Girl Aviators' Sky Cruise\" by Margaret Burnham is a children’s adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story primarily follows Peggy Prescott and her brother Roy as they navigate a new venture involving aeroplanes and uncovering the mystery surrounding a nearby aeroplane manufacturing company. With themes of adventure, competition, and ingenuity, the book promises an exciting tale as the characters confront challenges and rivalries in their pursuit of aeronautical prowess.  At the start of the narrative, Peggy and Roy are intrigued by the mysterious construction of a red building nearby, identified as the Mortlake Aeroplane Company. Their curiosity leads them to observe unusual activities and the arrival of a naval lieutenant, which intertwines with their own ambitions of testing their own aircraft. The opening chapters introduce key characters, including the antagonistic Mr. Harding and Eugene Mortlake, while setting the stage for the primary conflict between the Prescott siblings and their rivals. Tension builds as Peggy’s talent as a young aviator is showcased, particularly during a dramatic aerial demonstration and subsequent encounters that hint at deeper intrigues involving the aeroplane businesses.
