    "resumo": "\"Cannibal-land: Adventures with a Camera in the New Hebrides\" by Martin Johnson is an adventure narrative written in the early 20th century. The book recounts the experiences of the author and his wife, Osa Johnson, as they explore the New Hebrides, specifically the island of Malekula, known for its fierce natives and cannibalistic practices. The narrative is structured around their quest to capture the essence of primitive life through photography while confronting the dangers and surprises presented by the indigenous tribes.  The opening of the book sets the stage for Martin and Osa's journey, detailing their initial encounter with the New Hebrides from aboard their ship and their growing excitement for adventure in uncharted territories. The narrative introduces the couple's aspirations to document authentic tribal life and their apprehensions about encountering savage practices amidst the backdrop of ongoing tensions between the indigenous people and outside influences. Tension builds as Martin acknowledges the inherent risks associated with befriending the locals, particularly the feared Big Numbers tribe led by the cannibal chief Nagapate. The chapter ends on a thrilling note, as they encounter Nagapate and establish a tentative relationship, foreshadowing the challenges to come in their exploration of this culturally rich but perilous land.
