    "resumo": "\"Musical Travels Through England\" by Joel Collier is a whimsical account of the author's musical journey across England, written in the mid-18th century. This book serves as an exploratory travelogue that reflects on the cultural and musical landscape of England during that time, offering insights into the various musical practices and characters Collier encounters along his way.  The narrative unfolds as Collier, adopting the more euphonious name of ‘Collioni,’ embarks on an adventure filled with colorful encounters and humorous observations. He interacts with various musicians, townsfolk, and eccentric characters, highlighting the many forms of music and performance prevalent in different locales, from Lincoln to Bristol. Through a comedic lens, he presents anecdotal tales of musical mishaps, societal commentary, and the arts' influence on everyday life, all while underscoring the importance of music in shaping culture and identity.
