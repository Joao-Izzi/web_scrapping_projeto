    "resumo": "\"The Engineering Contributions of Wendel Bollman\" by Robert M. Vogel is a historical account published as part of the Smithsonian Institution's Bulletin series in the mid-20th century. The book primarily explores the life and significant innovations of Wendel Bollman, a self-taught civil engineer known for developing the Bollman truss, the first system utilizing iron as the principal material in bridge construction for American railroads. The work details the transformative impact of Bollman's contributions during the burgeoning era of railroad development in the 19th century.  In this detailed examination, Vogel chronicles Bollman's early career and his rise within the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, elucidating the technical aspects and challenges he faced while pioneering iron bridge construction. The book discusses notable projects, including the first all-iron Bollman truss built in 1850 and its applications in various locations, significantly enhancing the efficiency and safety of railroad infrastructure. Through comprehensive analysis, Vogel not only highlights Bollman's key achievements but also places his work within the broader context of 19th-century engineering practices, illustrating his lasting influence on modern structural engineering.
