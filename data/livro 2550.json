    "resumo": "\"Comme quoi Napoléon n'a jamais existé\" by J.-B. Pérès is a provocative work written in the early 20th century that challenges the historical existence of the renowned French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte. This book falls under the category of a critical historical treatise and presents an analysis that suggests Napoleon is an allegorical figure, symbolizing the sun. The author employs an intricate argument linking Napoleon's attributes, actions, and their descriptions to solar allegories and mythological frameworks prevalent in the 19th century.  In this work, Pérès systematically deconstructs various aspects of Napoleon's life, such as his birth on an island in the Mediterranean, his familial relations, and even his military exploits, arguing that these can all be traced back to sun mythology. He draws parallels between Napoleon and the figure of Apollo, asserting that each of Napoleon’s traits symbolizes different solar phenomena. Pérès concludes that the history written about Napoleon is not a factual account but rather a derived myth, revealing how society has misinterpreted these symbols as real events. This treatise serves both as a critique of historical narratives and as a reminder of the power of myth in shaping collective memory. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
