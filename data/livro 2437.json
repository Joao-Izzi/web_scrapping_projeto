    "resumo": "\"My Wayward Pardner; or, My Trials with Josiah, America, the Widow Bump, and…\" by Marietta Holley is a humorous and satirical novel written in the late 19th century. The book presents the trials and tribulations of the protagonist, Samantha, as she navigates her life with her husband, Josiah Allen, alongside various interactions with other characters in their community, including the intriguing Widow Bump. The narrative explores themes of marriage, gender roles, and societal expectations with wit and charm.  At the start of the story, we meet Samantha as she reflects on her life with Josiah, who has recently developed a curious habit of going to town in the evenings. This change in Josiah’s behavior arouses Samantha's suspicions, especially when he begins to speak in his sleep, calling out the name of the Widow Bump. Unbeknownst to her, Josiah's affections may be wandering, leading to a mix of comedic and serious realizations about love and partnerships. The opening sets the stage for an exploration of not only personal relationships but also broader societal commentaries on the nature of marriage and fidelity.
