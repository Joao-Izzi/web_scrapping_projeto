    "resumo": "\"Pietro Mascagni, con nota delle opere e ritratto\" by Giannotto Bastianelli is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book focuses on the life and works of the renowned Italian composer Pietro Mascagni, exploring his contributions to the operatic world and his place within the broader context of Italian music. Bastianelli examines Mascagni's notable operas, particularly his landmark work \"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" and discusses the characteristics of Italian opera and its evolution.  The opening of the text sets the stage for an in-depth analysis of the role of opera in Italy, emphasizing its popular appeal and the cultural context in which it developed. It begins with a discussion about the distinctive musical language of Italy, contrasting it with other European countries, while highlighting the influence of composers like Verdi and Rossini. The text also introduces Mascagni as a key figure in the continuation of the Italian operatic tradition, detailing the ways his work both reflects and transforms the popular and melodramatic elements typical of Italian opera during his time. Bastianelli proposes that while Mascagni's music is rooted in the past, it also seeks to address contemporary emotional and artistic needs, connecting the composer to the vibrant landscape of early 20th-century Italian culture.
