    "resumo": "\"When Day is Done\" by Edgar A. Guest is a collection of inspirational poetry written in the early 20th century. The poems explore themes of family, contentment, and the simple joys of everyday life, providing reflections that resonate with the desire for peace and a sense of belonging. Guest's verses often celebrate domestic life, the bonds between parents and children, and the value of humility and gratitude.  The opening of the collection sets a tranquil tone, introducing the reader to the comforting imagery of homecoming after a long day. The narrator reflects on the warmth of returning to a place filled with love, where children play and the cares of the outside world fade away. Through vivid descriptions, the poet captures the essence of contentment found in simple moments spent with family. This effectively establishes a nostalgic, sentimental atmosphere that invites readers to appreciate the beauty in their own ordinary experiences. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
