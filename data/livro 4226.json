    "resumo": "\"The Imaginary Invalid\" by Molière is a classic comedy written during the late 17th century. The play follows the antics of Argan, a hypochondriac who believes himself to be seriously ill, along with the amusing and chaotic interactions he has with his family, physicians, and servants, highlighting themes of love, medicine, and the absurdity of his condition.   The opening of the play introduces us to Argan as he obsessively tallies his expensive doctor’s bills, revealing his preoccupation with his health. Despite his belief in his ailments, he demonstrates both comedic ignorance and a stubborn refusal to consider that he is not seriously ill. We also meet Toinette, his witty maid, who challenges his delusions while supporting his daughter Angélique, who is in love with Cléante. This complicated web of relationships sets the stage for the ensuing conflict, particularly as Argan plans to marry Angélique off to the medical practitioner Thomas Diafoirus, a match she detests. As the scene unfolds, the audience is drawn into the humorous dialogue and manipulation as characters clash over Argan's misguided intentions and the implications for Angélique’s future.
