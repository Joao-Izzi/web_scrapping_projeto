    "resumo": "\"Aucassin & Nicolette, and Other Mediaeval Romances and Legends\" by Eugene Mason is a collection of medieval romances written during the early 20th century. The book primarily focuses on the enchanting tale of Aucassin, the son of the Count of Beaucaire, and his beloved Nicolette, a beautiful captive girl of unknown lineage. Through various legends and narratives from the Middle Ages, the work explores themes of love, chivalry, and societal conventions, offering readers a glimpse into a time when loyalty and devotion were paramount.  The opening of the collection introduces the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, setting a backdrop of conflict as Aucassin's father disapproves of his love for Nicolette, considering her a mere captive rather than an appropriate match. Aucassin is depicted as deeply enamored, rejecting the pursuits of knighthood and warfare in favor of his love for Nicolette. The tale unfolds with Aucassin's desperate attempts to be united with Nicolette, who is locked away by the Viscount, heightening the drama as Aucassinâ€™s father threatens her imprisonment. The poignant exchanges between Aucassin and his father illuminate the tension of love versus duty, creating an engaging narrative that draws readers into the complexities of medieval romance.
