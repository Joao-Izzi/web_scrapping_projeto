    "resumo": "\"The Cave in the Mountain\" by Edward Sylvester Ellis is a novel written during the late 19th century. This adventure story serves as a sequel to \"In the Pecos Country\" and follows two main characters, Fred Munson and Mickey O'Rooney, as they navigate a perilous journey through a cave filled with danger, intrigue, and the threat of Apache warriors. The narrative is packed with action and suspense as the boys face various trials, including encounters with wild animals and the complexities of survival in a hostile environment.  At the start of the novel, we find Fred and Mickey in a dark cave, where Fred becomes separated from Mickey while tracking a wolf he believes might lead him to safety. After a series of events, including Fred’s bold attempts to confront the creature and his unfortunate fall, he is left groping in darkness and worrying about Mickey’s safety. Meanwhile, we learn that Mickey is unaware of Fred's absence and is sleeping soundly, indicating a comedic contrast as Fred faces danger alone. This setup foreshadows a tale of unforeseen challenges and camaraderie, as both boys will eventually need to rely on their wits and courage to escape the cave and the lurking threats around them.
