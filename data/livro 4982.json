    "resumo": "\"Aphorisms and Reflections from the Works of T. H. Huxley\" by Thomas Henry Huxley is a collection of philosophical thoughts and insights written in the early 20th century. This volume compiles selected excerpts from Huxley's extensive writings, emphasizing his scientific, moral, and philosophical viewpoints. The book serves to illuminate the legacy and ideas of Huxley, particularly his advocacy for truth, knowledge, and the moral responsibilities of individuals within society.  The opening of the book begins with a preface by Henrietta A. Huxley, which provides context for the collection and reflects on the enduring relevance of her husband's thoughts. She expresses her desire for the selection to reach a broad audience, especially those unfamiliar with Huxley's complete works. Following the preface, the opening aphorisms present a series of reflections on subjects such as the importance of truth, the relationship between knowledge and morality, and the role of science in understanding the world and improving human life. Throughout these reflections, Huxley articulates his views on human dignity, the limits of authority, and the need for education and critical thinking in confronting social and ethical issues.
