    "resumo": "\"Vivian's Lesson\" by Elizabeth W. Grierson is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the experiences of a young boy named Vivian Armitage as he navigates family life, friendships, and personal challenges during the holiday season. The narrative hints at themes of moral growth, the importance of honesty, and the consequences of one's actions.  The opening portion introduces the reader to Vivian and his brother Ronald, who are leaving a skating rink after breaking their promise to return home on time. As they head home, tensions arise around expectations, peer pressure, and the boys' contrasting personalities. Vivian, particularly, grapples with feelings of inadequacy and the fear of not measuring up to his friends. The chapter establishes Vivian's character as impulsive and sensitive, wrestling with temptation and the desire to assert his identity against societal expectations, setting the stage for personal growth and moral lessons to unfold as the story progresses.
