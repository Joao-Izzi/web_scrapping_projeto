    "resumo": "\"Horae subsecivae. Rab and His Friends, and Other Papers\" by John Brown is a collection of reflective essays and stories written during the late 19th century. The primary piece included, \"Rab and His Friends,\" centers on an affectionate depiction of the bond between a young medical student, John, and a noble dog named Rab, exploring themes of loyalty, love, and the profound connection between humans and their animal companions.   At the start of the collection, the narrative dives into the youthful adventures of John and his friend Bob as they encounter a dog fight in the streets of Edinburgh, setting the stage for discussions on human nature and instincts. This scene introduces not only the lively nature of boys but also leads to the heartfelt tale of Rab, who becomes a cherished companion to both John and his owner, James. The storytelling emphasizes the affectionate traits observed in Rab, hinting at the deep emotional ties that the main characters will explore throughout their relationship, ultimately intertwining lessons of compassion and loss. The opening sets an engaging tone, blending humor, sadness, and a rich observation of both human and canine experiences. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
