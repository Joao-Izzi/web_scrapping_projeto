This work narrates the life and exploits of Hernan Cortes, focusing on his conquests and encounters during the Spanish colonization of Mexico. The book aims to provide a detailed depiction of Cortes's adventures as he faced numerous challenges in a foreign land, ultimately leading to the fall of the Aztec Empire.  The opening of the book introduces Hernan Cortes, beginning with his early life in the small town of Medellin, Spain, where he was born into a noble but impoverished family. As a restless youth, he struggled with his studies and displayed a keen interest in military exploits that would shape his future. The narrative highlights Cortes's early disappointments and setbacks regarding his ambitions to join military campaigns, including failed attempts to join the conquests in Italy and to accompany his kinsman to Hispaniola. After several fortuitous events, he finally embarks to the New World in search of fame and fortune, setting the stage for the adventures and conquests that would follow, including his growing aspirations to lead an expedition that would ultimately lead him to Mexico.
