    "resumo": "\"The International Spy\" by Allen Upward is a fictional narrative written in the early 20th century. This espionage tale interweaves the backdrop of the Russo-Japanese War, exploring the intense and secretive maneuvers of powerful figures who seek to manipulate the events leading to war. The story revolves around the enigmatic Monsieur V, a spy tasked with uncovering treachery, and the alluring yet dangerous Princess Y, who seems to play both sides against one another.  At the start of the narrative, readers are introduced to the serious atmosphere surrounding the threat of war. The prologue reveals two imperial sisters, one expressing deep concerns about the emerging submarine technology that could spell disaster for their nations, and hinting at the hidden interests pushing for conflict. As the story unfolds, Monsieur V is summoned to London, where he receives instructions from Lord Bedale regarding a potential war between Russia and Japan. V's unfolding mission takes him to St. Petersburg, where he encounters the duplicitous Princess Y and forms precarious alliances, all while navigating the treacherous world of espionage rife with deceit and hidden agendas. The opening effectively sets the stage for a gripping tale of intrigue, political maneuvering, and the personal stakes involved in actions that could change the course of nations.
