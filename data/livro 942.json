    "resumo": "\"A Tangled Tale\" by Lewis Carroll is a collection of whimsical mathematical tales written in the late 19th century. This work creatively blends storytelling with mathematical problems, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The narrative features various characters, including two travellers, knights, and a tutor, who find themselves in playful yet perplexing situations that require logical reasoning and problem-solving.  At the start of the tale, we meet two knights traversing a mountain, where they engage in a spirited conversation about their pace and the time of their ascent. As they descend, the younger knight's eagerness to know the distance they have traveled prompts the older knight to challenge him with a mathematical puzzle, setting the stage for the intertwining of narrative and arithmetic that characterizes the book. The opening also introduces other amusing characters, such as Balbus and a variety of landladies with \"eligible apartments,\" hinting at the mathematical enigmas that will unfold in subsequent chapters.
