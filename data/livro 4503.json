    "resumo": "\"Boyhood\" by Leo Tolstoy is a semi-autobiographical novel written during the late 19th century. The story chronicles the formative years of a young boy named Nikolai, exploring his journey from childhood to adolescence and the experiences that shape his understanding of life, family, and society.  The opening of \"Boyhood\" introduces readers to Nikolai as he embarks on a journey from his family estate to Moscow, revealing the poignant aftermath of his mother's death. As the family travels in their carriages, Nikolai's reflections oscillate between his feelings of melancholy over their loss and the excitement of new experiences ahead. Vivid descriptions of the landscape and the bustling life around him paint a nostalgic picture of childhood wonder and the bittersweet nature of growing up. His relationship with his brother Woloda, his emerging friendships, and the varying dynamics with the girls they encounter hint at the complexities of adolescence that will unfold throughout the narrative. The opening sets the stage for a deep exploration of transformative moments in Nikolai's life, capturing both the joy and turmoil of boyhood. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
