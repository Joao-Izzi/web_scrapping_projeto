    "resumo": "\"Engelbrekt Engelbrektinpoika I\" by C. Georg Starbäck is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set in the early 15th century and follows the life and struggles of Engelbrekt Engelbrektinpoika, who becomes embroiled in the turbulent politics of his time, facing challenges from oppressive authorities and rallying his fellow countrymen for justice.   The opening of the novel introduces us to a spring morning in May 1433 at Borganäs Castle, where a young man named Erkki is anxiously sneaking around. He encounters a beautiful praying girl, revealing his distress over the plight of his ailing mother, who is at the mercy of the local lord's oppressive demands. Their interaction is cut short by the arrival of guards searching for Erkki, leading to a frantic escape attempt that sets the tone for the unfolding drama. This segment hints at deeper themes of social injustice and the struggle for personal and collective freedom that are likely to be central throughout the narrative.
