    "resumo": "\"Experimentelle Untersuchungen über die Frage »Ist die Furcht vor Krankheitsübertragung durch das Telephon berechtigt«?\" by Carl Weiss is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work discusses the potential health risks associated with using telephones, particularly concerns regarding the transmission of infectious diseases via the device. It comprehensively analyzes various bacteriological studies to address public fears of contagion through telephone use.  In his investigation, Weiss conducts a series of experiments examining the presence and pathogenicity of microorganisms found on telephones in Greifswald. He meticulously describes the bacteria identified, their colonies, and the outcomes from using laboratory animals in tests to assess whether these bacteria could cause disease. The results of Weiss's studies suggest that the risk of infection through telephone use is minimal, dispelling prevalent fears and advocating for proper hygiene rather than unnecessary disinfection. Ultimately, the work offers a detailed and empirical conclusion that highlights the lack of justification for the societal anxieties regarding disease transmission through telephonic communication.
