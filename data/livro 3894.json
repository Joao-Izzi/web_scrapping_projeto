The story centers around a young boy named Riccardo Joanna, exploring his life and adventures as he navigates the challenges of childhood in a bustling environment filled with adults and their complexities. Through Riccardo, the narrative likely delves into themes of innocence, familial bonds, and the contrast between childhood simplicity and adult hardships.  The opening of this novel introduces us to Riccardo Joanna and his father, Paolo Joanna, as they begin their day in a modest living space filled with newspapers and remnants of the previous nightâ€™s activities. We observe the tender relationship between the father and son, with Paolo's careful attention to not disturb Riccardo while he sleeps. As Riccardo wakes and interacts with his servant, Marianna, the narrative reveals his playful and somewhat demanding nature, particularly around food. The father-son dynamic is further explored when Riccardo is described as a curious and astute child who observes his father's workplace at the newspaper, signaling the evolution of Riccardo's character as he uncovers the realities of adulthood intertwined with his innocent childlike wonder.
