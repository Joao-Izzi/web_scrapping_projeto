    "resumo": "\"Merely Mary Ann\" by Israel Zangwill is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the interactions between Lancelot, a struggling musician living in a modest lodging house, and Mary Ann, the unassuming and hard-working servant in the household. Through their encounters, the book explores themes of class disparity, ambition, and the human condition against the backdrop of South London life.  The opening of the novel introduces Lancelot as he navigates his mundane existence filled with music and creative aspirations. It portrays his first meetings with Mary Ann, initially noting her humble station and the drudgery of her daily tasks. Lancelot's interactions reveal a mixture of condescension and reluctant admiration for Mary Ann's character. As he grapples with his own artistic struggles, the dynamic between them begins to shift, leaving readers curious about their evolving relationship and the potential emotional undercurrents between a man striving for greatness and a girl labeled merely by her common name. This exploration of their lives offers a poignant reflection on the themes of worth and recognition in a world constrained by social class. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
