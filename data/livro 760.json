It encompasses themes of elegance, celebration, and the importance of social gatherings among the avian community.  The story revolves around the Peacock, who is incensed that other creatures, like butterflies and crickets, are gathering without inviting the birds to participate in their festivities.

As the guests arrive, they engage in playful antics, dancing, and enjoying a lavish banquet filled with various delicacies.
