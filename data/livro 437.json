    "resumo": "\"Die Mädchen des Pensionats: Humoreske\" by Ernst Eckstein is a humorous novel written in the late 19th century. This book centers around the daily lives and romantic aspirations of a group of young girls residing in a girls' boarding school. The narrative explores themes of friendship, love, and youthful fantasies against the backdrop of a strict educational setting.  The story unfolds primarily through the interactions of the eight girls, led by the eldest, Josephine, who assume a motherly role. As they enjoy an afternoon coffee, their conversations reveal their various crushes and imaginations surrounding a mysterious young gentleman who visits the school. Each girl imagines the nature of his character—whether he is a poet, a gentleman of noble birth, or an officer—leading to playful debates and romantic daydreams. The arrival of this young man incites a flurry of emotional responses, ranging from infatuation to jealousy, culminating in a humorous revelation of his true identity as an ordinary medical practitioner, which shakes their romantic fantasies.
