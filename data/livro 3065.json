    "resumo": "\"Frits Millioen en zijn vrienden\" by A. L. G. Bosboom-Toussaint is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story appears to revolve around themes of childhood, education, and social dynamics within a religious community, centering on characters such as Dominé Willems and the young boys and girls who partake in the catechization sessions he conducts. As the narrative unfolds, the interplay between the innocence of youth and the complexities of adult societal expectations begins to take shape, particularly against the backdrop of religious duties and social interactions.  The opening of the novel sets the scene with a lively depiction of children—both girls and boys—anxiously departing a catechization session at the home of Dominé Willems. The excitement and noise created by these children act as a clear contrast to the more somber environment of the catechization room. We see the dominé become absorbed in his thoughts and efforts to prepare a sermon, which seems to weigh heavy on his mind, hinting at his struggles with both inspiration and the expectations of his religious duties. The gathering of the children is not without its mischief, suggesting the energetic and perhaps unruly nature of youth that will undoubtedly play a central role in the development of the story.
