    "resumo": "\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" by Oscar Wilde is a poignant poem written in the late 19th century during the Victorian era. This narrative poem reflects on themes of guilt, love, and the harsh realities of justice as it unfolds within the confines of a prison. The work explores the experience of a condemned man and the psychological torment faced by both the perpetrator and those who witness the grim processes of capital punishment.  The poem follows the perspective of a fellow inmate in Reading Gaol, who observes the fate of a man sentenced to hang for murdering the woman he loved. Through vivid imagery and emotional depth, Wilde conveys the idea that everyone, in some way, kills the love they cherish, whether through betrayal, neglect, or direct harm. The poem critiques the justice system, exposing its cruelty and the complete lack of compassion in the face of human suffering. As the narrative progresses, it reflects the despair and moral conflict that arises within a system that takes life in the name of law, eliciting sympathy not only for the condemned but also for the common human experience of love and loss.
