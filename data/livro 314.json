    "resumo": "\"The Cameroons\" by Albert Frederick Calvert is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book examines the rise and fall of the German Colonial Empire, particularly focusing on the annexation and administration of the Cameroons. It aims to provide an in-depth exploration of Germany's interactions with native populations, their colonial strategies, and the economic potential of the territory.  The opening portion of the book sets the stage for a comprehensive historical commentary on Germany's colonial ambitions in Africa. It outlines the initial political maneuvers that allowed Germany to establish its presence in the Cameroons, detailing various treaties and agreements with other colonial powers and native leaders. Calvert highlights the dubious methods employed by German officials, emphasizing their desire for territorial expansion and resource exploitation, while also hinting at the eventual military clashes and administrative failures that would characterize German rule in the region.
