    "resumo": "\"Niccolò de' Lapi; ovvero, i Palleschi e i Piagnoni\" by Massimo d'Azeglio is a historical novel written in the early 19th century. The narrative centers around the tumultuous period of the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, focusing on the lives and struggles of the Florentine populace as they resist the forces of Carlo V. The key character, Niccolò de' Lapi, embodies the virtues of loyalty and courage in the face of adversity, particularly as he confronts both the external threat of imperial forces and the internal turmoil of a city gripped by political factionalism.  The opening of the novel introduces readers to the gravity of the situation in Florence as it faces siege. The narrative begins with the funeral of a young man, likely a casualty of the ongoing struggle, and captures the mood of grief and determination among the citizens. Niccolò de' Lapi is portrayed as a revered elder in his community, grappling with the loss of his son while preparing his remaining children, especially the young Bindo, for the dangers that lie ahead. D'Azeglio establishes a vivid picture of the city’s atmosphere, blending personal tragedy with the collective turmoil of a society on the brink, effectively setting the stage for the unfolding drama centered on resilience, sacrifice, and the fight for freedom.
