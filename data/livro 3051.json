    "resumo": "\"Esther\" by Jean Racine is a tragic play written in the late 17th century. The story is based on the biblical tale of Esther, a Jewish queen who must risk her life to save her people from destruction. This work exemplifies the height of French classical tragedy, showcasing themes of courage, identity, and divine providence.  At the start of the play, Esther expresses her deep sorrow for the plight of her people and reflects on her rise to become queen after the banishment of Vashti. As she interacts with her confidante, Elise, we learn about the impending doom faced by the Jewish people due to a royal decree orchestrated by the villainous Aman, who seeks to annihilate them. Mardoch√©e, Esther's uncle, implores her to reveal her true identity to the king and plead for the lives of their people, setting the stage for the ensuing tension, moral dilemmas, and the exploration of Esther's intimate connection to her homeland and faith.
