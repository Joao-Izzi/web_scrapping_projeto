    "resumo": "\"Le musée du Louvre, tome 1 (of 2)\" by Armand Dayot is a richly illustrated art book written in the early 20th century. The work serves as a comprehensive guide to the masterpieces housed in the Louvre Museum, aiming to educate and inspire appreciation for fine art among its readers. It features a collection of famous paintings alongside critical insights into the artists and their techniques.  At the start of the work, the author reflects on the surprisingly low attendance at the Louvre and attributes this to a lack of understanding and appreciation for art among both locals and visitors. He emphasizes the importance of art education and sets out to make the masterpieces more accessible to the public through vivid descriptions and analyses, accompanied by colored illustrations. The opening presents Dayot’s intent to create an engaging and varied exploration of the museum’s extensive collection rather than a strictly systematic presentation of the artworks.
