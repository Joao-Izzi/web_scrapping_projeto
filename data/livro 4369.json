    "resumo": "\"Kemps Nine Daies Wonder: Performed in a Daunce from London to Norwich\" by William Kemp is a satirical account written in the early 17th century. This work combines elements of autobiography and travelogue as it recounts the comic actor's journey from London to Norwich while performing a morris dance, showcasing his experiences during the trek and addressing the slanderous tales propagated by ballad-makers.   The opening of the work introduces William Kemp, a well-known comic actor of the Elizabethan stage, who embarks on a unique journey where he not only dances but engages with the local populace along the way. Kemp sets off from London, accompanied by his taberer, and is met with an array of responses from the townspeople, ranging from kindness to mockery. He describes the various obstacles and humorous situations he encounters, including people attempting to join his dance and the challenges of navigating through crowds. His light-hearted tone establishes the blend of humor and reflection that characterizes the entire work, setting the stage for a delightful narrative filled with entertaining anecdotes from his travels.
