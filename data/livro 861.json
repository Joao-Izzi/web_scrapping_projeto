    "resumo": "\"The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees\" by James Mooney is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work focuses on the preservation of the sacred knowledge and medical practices of the Cherokee people, including over six hundred formulas related to medicine, love, hunting, and spirituality. It provides insight into the beliefs and customs of the Cherokee, illustrating the unique intersection of their ancient religion with their practical life.  At the start of the book, Mooney introduces the collection of sacred formulas he obtained from Cherokee shamans on a reservation in North Carolina during the late 1800s. He details the significance of these manuscripts, emphasizing how they serve not only as a medical compendium but also as a reflection of Cherokee culture and spirituality. The opening chapters discuss the origins of these formulas, the challenges of gathering them, and the intricate relationship between the shamans and their community. Through various stories and explanations, Mooney seeks to highlight the depth of Cherokee traditions and the importance of their healing practices within the broader context of their sacred beliefs.
