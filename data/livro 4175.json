    "resumo": "\"Frontier Service During the Rebellion\" by George H. Pettis is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book details the experiences of Company K of the First Infantry, California Volunteers during the American Civil War. It focuses on the challenges faced by Union troops stationed at the frontier in California and New Mexico, providing insights into military life, skirmishes, and interactions with Indigenous peoples amid the broader context of the rebellion.  In this compelling narrative, Pettis recounts the formation and deployment of his regiment in response to the Civil War, emphasizing the urgency felt in California after the Bull Run battle.
