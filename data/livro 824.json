    "resumo": "\"The Widow Barnaby\" by Frances Milton Trollope is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story centers around the Compton sisters, particularly Miss Martha Compton, as it explores family dynamics, financial struggles, and society's pressures in a quaint Devonshire town. Characters such as the timid Reverend Josiah Compton and the proud Mrs. Compton set the stage for the unfolding drama, hinting at the conflicts that arise due to class and wealth.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to the Compton family and their challenges. Miss Martha and her sister Sophia are the daughters of a curate, living with the weight of maternal expectations and societal roles. Mrs. Compton is depicted as determined yet financially challenged, aiming to showcase her daughters at an upcoming fête, while Mr. Compton seems overwhelmed by these demands. The narrative establishes the tone of familial relations, particularly focusing on the contrasting perspectives of Miss Betsy Compton, their financially independent yet bitter sister-in-law. As Mrs. Compton prepares for the fête, she schemes to borrow money to dress her daughters appropriately, setting the stage for Miss Betsy's blunt realism and the clash of ideals that will play out throughout the story.
