    "resumo": "\"The Shaggy Man of Oz\" by Jack Snow is a children's fantasy novel written in the mid-20th century. This work builds upon the beloved Oz universe originally created by L. Frank Baum, featuring familiar characters and introducing new ones, including the titular Shaggy Man. The plot centers around the Shaggy Man as he embarks on an adventurous quest, interacting with various whimsical figures along the way in the enchanting world of Oz.  The opening of the story introduces twins Tom and Twink, who are feeling bored on a rainy day in Buffalo. Their mundane afternoon quickly transforms into an extraordinary adventure when they unexpectedly walk through their television screen and find themselves in the magical Isle of Conjo, led by a wooden clown named Twiffle. Meanwhile, the Shaggy Man is in Oz, worried about the broken Love Magnet, an important magical item. As they navigate their new surroundings, the twins are drawn into a plot concerning the wizard Conjo, who has his own plans involving the children, setting the stage for a tale of magic, friendship, and the exploration of the unknown.
