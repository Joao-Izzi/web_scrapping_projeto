    "resumo": "\"Live to be Useful\" by Anonymous is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book tells the story of a young crippled girl named Annie Lee and her Irish nurse, Annorah, illuminating themes of compassion, faith, and personal growth despite life's adversities. Set against a backdrop of early 1900s societal norms, the narrative explores the transformative power of love and education.  Annie Lee, confined to her home due to a debilitating illness, is a beacon of hope and kindness. She inspires her nurse Annorah, who initially harbors bitterness and ignorance due to her upbringing, to seek knowledge and embrace a new faith. As Annie teaches Annorah how to read and understand the Christian faith, they form a deep bond that leads to Annorah's gradual transformation. However, their relationship and Annorah's newfound beliefs come under threat from the priest and local community, culminating in Annie's untimely death. In her absence, Annorah emerges as a leader in her community, helping to spread the teachings she learned from Annie, which in turn fosters hope and change among her people.
