    "resumo": "\"Die natürliche Tochter\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a dramatic play written during the late 18th century. The narrative revolves around themes of identity, family, and societal expectations, focusing on the central character, Eugenie, who navigates the complexities of her birthright and personal desires in a world fraught with intrigue and tragedy.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to a scenic forest setting where a king and a duke engage in conversation. They reflect on the burdens of kingship and the joy of familial bonds, hinting at deeper questions about their own lives. The discussion quickly turns to the king's acknowledgment of a noble secret: the existence of a daughter, Eugenie, whose identity and connection to nobility are shrouded in mystery due to the death of her mother. As events unfold, the audience witnesses a series of dramatic moments, including a near-fatal horse accident involving Eugenie, which serves as a catalyst for revealing hidden truths and tensions among the characters. The opening captures a sense of impending doom mixed with hope, foreshadowing the complex interplay of relationships that will evolve throughout the play.
