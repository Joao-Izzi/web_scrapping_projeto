The story is set in a small town and follows the life of Carmel Lee, who unexpectedly inherits the struggling \"Gibeon Free Press\" after the death of her uncle. Faced with the challenge of running the newspaper, Carmel must navigate her relationships with the quirky staff, including Tubal and Simmy, while contending with the local power dynamics that threaten her new endeavor. The novel blends humor with a sense of social commentary as Carmel strives to establish herself as a capable editor.  The opening of the story introduces us to Carmel's arrival in Gibeon, where she discovers the dire state of her inheritance, a nearly defunct newspaper.
