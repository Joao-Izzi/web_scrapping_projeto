    "resumo": "\"Oxford Poetry, 1921\" edited by Alan Porter, Robert Graves, and Richard Arthur Warren Hughes is a collection of poetry compiled during the early 20th century, reflective of the literary trends and sentiments of that time. This anthology features works from various undergraduate contributors at Oxford University, showcasing a diverse range of poetic voices. The likely topic of the book can be understood as an exploration of personal and collective experiences during a tumultuous period marked by the aftermath of the First World War.  The collection comprises a selection of poems that reflect on themes of nature, love, loss, and personal introspection. Contributors such as Edmund Blunden and Robert Graves offer poignant reflections on time and memory, with pieces like \"The Watermill\" conveying nostalgic imagery intertwined with the pain of loss. Other poems, like \"Cynics and Romantics,\" critique societal norms and explore the complexities of love and relationships. Throughout the collection, there is an evident tension between the idyllic and the stark realities of life, encapsulating the emotional richness of the era and the search for meaning in a changing world. The work collectively provides a window into the thoughts and feelings of young poets grappling with identity and existence during a significant historical moment.
