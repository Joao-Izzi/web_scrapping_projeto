This anthology features various tales set in Italy, showcasing the rich experiences and cultural nuances of English authors who drew inspiration from the Italian landscape and society. The opening story, “A Faithful Retainer” by James Payn, explores themes of loyalty and youthful folly in the context of society and gambling.  At the start of “A Faithful Retainer,” the narrator reflects on their childhood connection to the Luscombe family, particularly Richard, the only son, who exhibits a penchant for gambling. The narrator recalls a pivotal moment when, as young boys, they venture to a local racecourse, leading to a series of misadventures involving a swindling bookmaker. As Richard experiences the thrill of winning, he becomes increasingly reckless, ultimately leading to his financial ruin when his trusted butler steals his winnings.
