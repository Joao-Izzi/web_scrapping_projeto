    "resumo": "\"Merille karannut: Seikkailuromaani Afrikan rannikolta\" by Mayne Reid is an adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The book tells the story of a young boy who escapes to the sea at the age of sixteen, driven by a desire for adventure and exploration, despite having a loving family at home. The narrative likely explores themes of freedom, the harsh realities of life at sea, and the transformation of the protagonist as he navigates both physical challenges and moral dilemmas.  At the start of the novel, the young protagonist reflects on his upbringing and the strong urge that compelled him to abandon the comforts of his family for the unpredictable life at sea. After successfully escaping, he quickly encounters the grueling reality of life aboard the ship \"Pandora,\" where he faces severe mistreatment from the crew, particularly from the cruel captain and first mate. His initial longing for adventure is soon replaced with regret as he grapples with perilous circumstances and the brutal hierarchy of ship life, where every member of the crew regards him as an inferior. Despite the grim treatment, he finds an ally in Ben Brace, a fellow sailor who stands up for him and offers a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
