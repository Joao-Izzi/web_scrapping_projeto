    "resumo": "\"Angelic Wisdom Concerning the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom\" by Emanuel Swedenborg is a philosophical and theological treatise written in the mid-18th century. The work delves into the nature of divine love and wisdom, exploring their interrelation and significance in understanding life and God. Swedenborg presents profound concepts regarding the nature of existence, the spiritual world, and humanity's connection to the divine.  The opening of the book presents an exploration of love as the essence of human life, emphasizing that while love is commonly understood and spoken about, its true nature often eludes people. Swedenborg argues that love is not just an abstract feeling but the very life force that drives thoughts, actions, and existence itself. He elaborates that God is the embodiment of love and wisdom, illustrating his ideas through analogies with the natural world, such as the heat and light of the sun, which symbolize divine love and wisdom. Through this philosophical discourse, the initial chapters lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the divine as it permeates life, both human and heavenly.
