    "resumo": "\"Shot With Crimson\" by George Barr McCutcheon is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story begins amidst a tense atmosphere as an explosion is heard at a nearby munitions plant during a dinner party at the Black Downs Country Club. The characters grapple with their panic and fear regarding the potential implications of the explosion, and themes of suspicion against German-Americans emerge against the backdrop of World War I.  The opening of the book sets the stage for a gripping social drama filled with anxiety and conflict. A group of club members, including Mrs. Carstairs, her husband Davenport, and their son Alfred, find themselves disoriented and concerned for their safety as the shockwaves from the explosion reach them. As the narrative unfolds, differing perspectives on identity, loyalty, and fear regarding the war atmosphere become apparent, particularly illustrated through the character of Paul Zimmerlein, who navigates systemic treachery while maintaining his fa√ßade of a good American. The tension escalates as the evening progresses, revealing underlying themes of paranoia and loyalty in times of crisis. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
