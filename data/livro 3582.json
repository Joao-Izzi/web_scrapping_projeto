    "resumo": "\"Changing China\" by the Rev. Lord William Gascoyne-Cecil, assisted by Lady Florence Cecil, is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work explores the dramatic transformations occurring in China during a pivotal time of political and social upheaval. The authors, motivated by their missionary experiences, aim to highlight the need for Western education and the influence of Christianity on the evolving Chinese society.  At the start of the book, the authors share their motivation for writing following significant experiences in China, including their involvement with the China Emergency Committee and a tour of the country. They illustrate a dramatic shift from China’s historical conservatism to a burgeoning spirit of progress marked by Western influences and national movements. They emphasize the dual forces that awakened this change: the rising demand for education inspired by China’s recent humiliations, and the role of Christianity in shaping modern Chinese thought. Through engaging anecdotes and observations, they set the stage for a deeper exploration of how these transformations might impact both China and the wider world.
