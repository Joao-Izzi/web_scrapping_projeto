    "resumo": "\"Travels into North America, Volume 2 (of 3)\" by Pehr Kalm is a scientific travel narrative written in the mid-18th century. The work presents an in-depth exploration of North America's natural history, agriculture, and the social practices of its inhabitants, with Kalm drawing on his personal observations and experiences during his travels. The book combines detailed descriptions of botany, agriculture, and the ecological interactions between settlers and indigenous populations, offering readers a nuanced perspective on early American society.  At the start of the narrative, Kalm recounts his experiences in New Jersey on December 7, 1748, highlighting the favorable conditions that contribute to higher population growth in the region compared to Europe. He shares anecdotes about local families, detailing their large progeny and longevity, which illustrates the opportunities and social freedoms available in colonial America. Kalm continues by discussing various insects native to the area, including mosquitoes, locusts, and caterpillars, emphasizing their impacts on local agriculture. His observations on the natural environment are enriched with descriptions of the flora, fauna, and daily life of the colonists, setting the stage for a comprehensive study of North America as he saw it in the 18th century.
