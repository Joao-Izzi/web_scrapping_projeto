    "resumo": "\"Cronus of the D. F. C.\" by Jr. Lloyd Biggle is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century. The story revolves around an innovative, albeit experimental, law enforcement technology known as Cronus, which allows police officers to glimpse future crimes. This narrative explores themes of fate, free will, and the moral dilemmas of knowing potential future events but perhaps being powerless to change them.  In the plot, police detective Jim Forsdon is introduced to Cronus, a device that shows future crimes but complicates the ability to prevent them. Tasked with investigating a potential murder shown on Cronus, Forsdon discovers that the victim, Stella Emerson, is linked to a large, troubled man named Mike Gregory. As Forsdon works to protect Stella, they both navigate the precarious nature of fate and inevitability, ultimately leading to Gregory's confrontation with the law. Despite the seemingly predestined outcomes highlighted by the technology, the characters strive for human connection and action, culminating in a tense resolution where Forsdon must confront his feelings and the future that seems inevitable.
