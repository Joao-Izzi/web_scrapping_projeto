    "resumo": "\"The Black Cat: A Play in Three Acts\" by John Todhunter is a theatrical work written in the late 19th century. The play explores complex human relationships within the context of modern societal norms, particularly focusing on themes of love, infidelity, and the struggles of marriage. The principal characters include Arthur Denham, a painter caught in a tumultuous relationship with his wife, Constance, and an alluring old friend, Blanche Tremaine, who stirs feelings of passion and conflict.  The beginning of the play sets the scene in Denham's studio, introducing Undine, the couple's daughter, who complains about her arithmetic homework. The interaction among the family members reveals a strained dynamic, as Constance expresses her frustrations while Denham attempts to maintain a lighter demeanor. Soon, the arrival of Mrs. Tremaine brings an air of nostalgia and complexity, as she and Denham navigate their past friendship amidst Constance's discontent. The first act establishes a mix of innocence, bitterness, and underlying tensions, ultimately foreshadowing the deeper conflicts that will arise as the characters confront their desires and the societal pressures surrounding them.
