    "resumo": "\"Don Juan Tenorio\" by José Zorrilla is a dramatic play written in the mid-19th century, renowned as a classic of Spanish literature. The story centers around the infamous character Don Juan Tenorio, a reckless and charming libertine who engages in various amorous exploits and challenges morality in his pursuit of pleasure and conquest.  The opening of the play sets the scene in an inn during the lively celebrations of Carnival, where Don Juan is introduced as a cunning and flamboyant character. He writes a letter intended for Doña Inés, the object of his affections, while his servant, Ciutti, and the innkeeper, Buttarelli, discuss their master’s reputation. A wager between Don Juan and his acquaintance Don Luis Mejía is established, laying the groundwork for a contest of seduction and moral defiance. As the carnival revelry unfolds, the tensions rise with the arrival of articulated figures and potential witnesses of their sinister games, hinting at the larger implications of Don Juan's reckless lifestyle on himself and those around him. This engaging introduction quickly immerses the audience in themes of love, rivalry, and the impending consequences of libertinism. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
