    "resumo": "\"Nanon\" by George Sand is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds through the eyes of a young girl named Nanon, who reflects on her childhood experiences of poverty, family, and the challenges of her rural upbringing. The narrative aims to capture both personal memories and the broader social environment of the time, emphasizing themes of social class and personal growth.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Nanon, who begins recounting her early life around the age of eleven, raised by her kind but stern great-uncle after losing her parents to smallpox. As she shares her memories, we learn about their modest existence, their struggles as poor peasants, and the importance of responsibility through her newfound role in caring for a sheep she affectionately names Rosette. The narrative captures her initial innocence, the confusion of childhood, and her gradual discovery of a sense of identity and purpose as she takes on tasks that matter for both her family and her beloved animal. Through these experiences, the reader is drawn into the emotional and social landscape of Nanon's world, paving the way for further exploration of her character and her community's dynamics.
