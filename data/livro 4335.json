    "resumo": "\"The Holy Piby\" by Robert Athlyi Rogers is a spiritual text written in the early 20th century. It serves as a religious publication that provides a reinterpretation of biblical doctrine, with a particular focus on the salvation and empowerment of people of Ethiopian descent. The book appears to emphasize themes of unity, self-discipline, and social justice within its religious narrative.  In \"The Holy Piby,\" the author presents a divine revelation through the character of Shepherd Athlyi, who is depicted as chosen by God to lead the Ethiopian people towards liberation and truth. The narrative unfolds through various books that structure the text, addressing the creation, the role of Jesus Christ, and the necessity of the Ethiopian people's return to their roots. Athlyi advocates for love and unity among his followers, encouraging them to embrace industry, justice, and faith. The text also serves to establish a new religious identity distinct from mainstream Christianity, affirming the belief that the fate of Ethiopia's generations rests in their adherence to the holy law given through Athlyi and his apostles, particularly Marcus Garvey, recognized as a key figure in the movement for the empowerment of African people.
