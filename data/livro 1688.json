    "resumo": "\"Scottish Poetry of the Sixteenth Century\" by George Eyre-Todd is a collection of Scottish poetry written in the late 19th century. The work showcases various poets from the sixteenth century, including Sir David Lyndsay, John Bellenden, and King James V, offering a rich exploration of the themes and socio-political milieu of that period. The anthology aims to revive interest in this era's poetic contributions, emphasizing their historical significance and the challenges the poets faced.  At the start of the anthology, the author sets the stage by reflecting on the impact of significant historical events, such as the Battle of Flodden Field and the onset of the Reformation, on Scottish poetry and society. The introduction provides context for why this period marks a pivotal shift in the literary landscape, discussing the decline of feudalism, the change in the Scottish language, and how these elements influenced the poetry produced. The reader is then introduced to a variety of poets whose works illustrate the complexities of their time, balancing social commentary with literary artistry, while highlighting Lyndsay's prominence as both a poet and a reformer.
