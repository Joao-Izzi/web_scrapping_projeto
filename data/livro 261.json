    "resumo": "\"The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain\" by Charles Dickens is a novel written during the mid-19th century. The story centers around Mr. Redlaw, a solitary and seemingly haunted chemist who carries the burdens of past sorrows, wrongs, and regrets. As the narrative unfolds, the introduction of a spectral presence raises questions about memory, loss, and the human condition.  The opening of the book establishes Mr. Redlaw as a reclusive figure trapped in a melancholic existence. He is observed in his lonely dwelling, showcasing the chilling atmosphere and his internal turmoil. Following a series of reflective monologues, he encounters a ghostly apparition that mirrors his own haunted essence, ultimately leading to an unsettling proposition: to forget all sorrows and troubles and spread that forgetfulness to others. The stark contrast between Redlaw’s tortured memories and the warmth of family life surrounding him—a sick student cared for by a kind-hearted woman—sets the stage for a poignant exploration of the price of forgetting and the nature of true happiness.
