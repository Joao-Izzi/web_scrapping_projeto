    "resumo": "\"Mansfield Park\" by Jane Austen is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story unfolds around the life and experiences of Fanny Price, a young girl who is sent to live with her wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park. The themes of class, morality, and the complexities of human relationships are woven throughout the narrative as Fanny navigates her new environment.  At the start of the story, we learn about Fanny Price's background and her transition from her own impoverished family to the Bertram household. Introduced to her new relatives, Fanny is shy and timid, struggling to fit in with her more affluent cousins who are critical of her background and education. The opening chapters set the stage for the exploration of Fanny's character and her relationships with the various members of the Bertram family, particularly Edmund Bertram, who shows her kindness and compassion amidst the indifference of others. As she grapples with her identity within this new class structure, the groundwork is laid for the intricate social dynamics and moral questions that will drive the plot forward.
