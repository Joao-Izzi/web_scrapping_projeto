    "resumo": "\"A Philosophical Dictionary, Volume 10\" by Voltaire is a philosophical work written in the 18th century. This volume is part of a larger collection that combines a critique of established beliefs, particularly those regarding religion and superstition, with insightful commentary on various philosophical topics. Voltaire employs wit and sarcasm to challenge traditional views and encourage readers to think critically and independently.  The opening of the volume delves into the importance of style and eloquence in writing, emphasizing how an appropriate style must align with the subject matter to achieve clarity and impact. Voltaire reflects on past literary works, critiquing their failure to adopt suitable styles for different genres and the consequent feebleness in expression. He warns against both flowery language that detracts from serious discourse and the negligence of an appropriate tone, establishing a foundation for discussing writing and philosophy as interconnected pursuits requiring careful consideration and artistry.
