    "resumo": "\"The Problems of Psychical Research\" by Hereward Carrington is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work explores the theoretical and experimental aspects of psychical phenomena, emphasizing psychological dimensions over physical manifestations, and offers insights drawn from years of research in the realm of the supernormal. The author aims to unravel the complexities of psychic phenomena and to examine the nature of the intelligence behind these occurrences.  The opening of the book presents Carrington's reflections on the status of psychical research as a legitimate scientific discipline. He argues that if any psychical phenomena can be proven true, then the field merits serious scientific inquiry; otherwise, it remains speculative. He discusses the complexities and challenges faced by researchers, acknowledging the potential for fraud and misinterpretation while advocating for systematic investigation into the nature of mediumistic communications. Carrington also highlights the need for future explorations into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and suggests that a deeper understanding of consciousness might emerge from continued study.
