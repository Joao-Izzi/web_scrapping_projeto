    "resumo": "\"Smugglers' Island and the Devil Fires of San Moros\" by Clarissa A. Kneeland is a children's adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Marian Hadley and her younger brother Delbert, along with their little sisters, as they embark on a daring trip to Smugglers' Island, which is rich in unsolved mysteries from pirate days. This seemingly simple picnic evolves into a survival narrative when they find themselves stranded on the island after the unexpected theft of their launch boat.  The opening of the novel introduces the Hadley family, where Marian is tasked with caring for her siblings, including spirited Delbert and frail Jennie. As excitement builds around their planned excursion to Smugglers' Island, tensions rise when they discover their launch has been stolen by Mr. Pearson, leaving them alone on the island. Facing initial fears and the challenges of survival, Marian steps into the role of protector, demonstrating resourcefulness and resolve as she leads her younger siblings in foraging for food, seeking shelter, and constructing a makeshift existence while they await rescue. The beginning sets the stage for an adventurous tale rich in themes of courage, family bonds, and resilience against the odds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
