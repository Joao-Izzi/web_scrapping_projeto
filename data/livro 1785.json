    "resumo": "\"Introduction to the Study of the History of Language\" by Herbert A. Strong et al. is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This comprehensive work delves into the processes and principles underpinning the development of language, examining specific theories and examining the changes that occur over time. The authors aim to provide a clear understanding of the evolution of language, particularly focusing on sound changes, shifts in word meanings, and the psychological aspects of linguistic development.  The opening of the book sets the stage for a thorough exploration of language history. Strong and his co-authors discuss the disciplines within language study, such as historical grammar and descriptive grammar, and emphasize the complexity and variability of language development. They introduce the reader to concepts like sound change, the role of individual speakers in shaping language, and the interplay of conscious and unconscious processes in the evolution of speech. By establishing these foundational theories, the authors prepare the reader for a more detailed examination of the intricacies of language change throughout the text.
