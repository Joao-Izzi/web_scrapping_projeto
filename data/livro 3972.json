    "resumo": "\"Lord Lister No. 0388: Een nieuwe Strijd\" by Matull, Blankensee, and Hageman is a fictional work set in a somewhat modern period, possibly the early 20th century. The story follows John Raffles, known as the Gentleman-Intruder, who is embroiled in a violent feud with his arch-nemesis, Irwin Stanley, the leader of a notorious criminal syndicate called the Society of the Golden Key. This tale explores themes of honor, retribution, and the moral complexity of its characters as they navigate a dangerous game.  At the start of the narrative, Raffles and his younger companion, Charly Brand, are racing through the night in a car. Raffles is gravely injured, hinting at past confrontations with Stanley who has tortured him for secrets. The tone is filled with tension as accusations and past grievances shape their dialogue. Raffles is depicted as a fierce but ethical character, determined to confront Stanley according to the rules of honor rather than resorting to cowardice. This opening sets the stage for imminent conflict and reflects the complexities of the characters' past interactions, foreshadowing a climactic confrontation that intertwines their fates.
