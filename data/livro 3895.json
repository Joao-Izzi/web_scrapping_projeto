    "resumo": "\"The Mythology of the British Islands\" by Charles Squire is an introduction to Celtic myth, legend, poetry, and romance written in the early 20th century. The book aims to provide English readers with an accessible understanding of the rich mythical and literary heritage of the Gaelic and British Celts, illuminating key figures and stories that have shaped this ancient mythology. It poses Celtic mythology as an essential counterpart to other well-known mythologies, illuminating how these tales have intertwined with English literary heritage.  The opening of the book discusses the significance of Celtic mythology and its impact on English literature by establishing the profound value of early legendary and poetic records. Squire articulates the transition of literary inspiration from Graeco-Roman sources to Celtic roots, suggesting a revival of interest in indigenous mythological traditions. He introduces the notion that Celtic mythology, while less explored in the literary canon, offers a fresh and native stream of inspiration for understanding the cultural and poetic landscape of the British Isles. This sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the mythical landscape and its characters that will follow in subsequent chapters. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
