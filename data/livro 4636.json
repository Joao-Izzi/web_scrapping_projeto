    "resumo": "\"The Last of the Barons — Volume 09\" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton is a historical novel likely written during the mid-19th century. It explores the power struggles and conflicts of 15th-century England, centred around figures such as Edward IV and the discontented Earl of Warwick. The narrative dives into themes of rebellion, loyalty, and the complexities of human relationships against the backdrop of a turbulent political landscape.  The opening of the book sets up a dramatic situation where Hilyard, a character imprisoned in the Earl's home, is unexpectedly pulled into a rebellion against King Edward IV, fueled by the Earl of Warwick's transformation from a loyal supporter to a fierce adversary. Warwick's anger stems from personal slights, particularly regarding the affections surrounding his daughter, Anne. As Hilyard rides to deliver a message of solidarity to another rebel leader, tensions heighten with the King still grappling with the ramifications of his actions. The narrative paints a vivid picture of the discontent brewing among the nobles while introducing key players and their motivations, setting the stage for impending conflict.
