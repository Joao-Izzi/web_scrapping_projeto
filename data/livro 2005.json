    "resumo": "\"Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation\" by Saint Thomas More is a philosophical dialogue written in the mid-16th century. This work ventures into profound discussions about comfort in the face of suffering and tribulations, primarily exploring the perspectives of two characters, Vincent and Anthony. The text addresses the relationship between earthly suffering, God's providence, and ultimate comfort, aiming to offer solace and counsel during difficult times.  The opening of this dialogue sets the stage with Vincent seeking comfort from his uncle Anthony as they navigate the fears incited by imminent turmoil, such as invasions by the Turks. Vincent expresses the need for guidance in responding to the calamities threatening their community, prompting Anthony to share insights about the nature of tribulation and the spiritual strength that can arise from enduring such challenges. Their conversation reveals underlying themes of faith, the necessity of seeking divine wisdom, and the potential for moral growth through suffering, establishing a meditative tone that invites readers to reflect on their own experiences of tribulation and the sources of true comfort.
