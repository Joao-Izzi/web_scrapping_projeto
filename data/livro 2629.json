    "resumo": "\"Christopher Columbus and the New World of His Discovery — Volume 2\" by Filson Young is a historical account likely written in the early 20th century. The book delves into the life and journeys of Christopher Columbus as he pursues his ambitious idea of maritime exploration to the west, aiming to discover new territories and establish a route to the riches he believes lie across the Atlantic.  At the start of the narrative, we find Columbus planning his proposal to the King of Portugal for support on his expedition. The text introduces key figures who assist Columbus in refining his scientific knowledge and proposal, including his brother Bartholomew and Martin Behaim, a significant figure in navigation. Despite his earnest efforts, Columbus faces skepticism from learned men presenting their academic views against his ambitious plans. The opening highlights Columbus's character—how he steadfastly clings to his vision despite a lack of formal education and persistent rejection, all while preparing for the significant role he believes he will play in world history.
