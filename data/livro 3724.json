    "resumo": "\"Dante\" by Edmund G. Gardner is a scholarly publication written in the early 20th century. This work serves as a revision of Gardner’s earlier \"Dante Primer,\" reflecting insights into the life and significance of the poet Dante Alighieri, with discussions surrounding his notable work, the \"Divina Commedia.\" The book explores not only Dante's literary accomplishments but also his historical and political contexts, examining his role as a national hero for Italy.  The opening portion begins by situating Dante within the backdrop of the Middle Ages, highlighting the tumultuous political landscape of Italy during his lifetime, marked by conflicts between the Guelfs and Ghibellines. It introduces Dante’s background, including his family lineage and the city of Florence where he was born. As it transitions into his youth, the narrative touches on his love for Beatrice, a significant influence in his poetic work, and outlines the early events leading to his eventual exile which would shape much of his writing and philosophical thought throughout his life. This introductory section lays the groundwork for deeper explorations of Dante's contributions to literature and the evolving nature of Italian society during his era.
