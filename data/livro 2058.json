    "resumo": "\"Historical Record of the Nineteenth, or the First Yorkshire North Riding Regiment of Foot\" by Richard Cannon is a historical account written in the mid-19th century. This comprehensive work documents the formation and military engagements of the Nineteenth Regiment from its inception in 1688 through its significant activities until 1848. The account includes details of battles, notable figures, and the regiment's evolution over time, reflecting the broader context of British military history.  The opening of the work introduces the background of the Nineteenth Regiment, outlining the circumstances surrounding its formation during the political upheaval of 1688 when the Prince of Orange initiated a movement to secure the constitutional rights of England. The text details the initial enlistment of troops and the appointment of Colonel Francis Lutterell as their leader shortly after the regiment's establishment. Following the sequence of events in the years leading to the early engagements in Ireland and Flanders, the beginning provides a foundational understanding of the regiment's early operations and its early connection to pivotal military campaigns in British history.
