    "resumo": "\"A History of Science — Volume 5\" by Henry Smith Williams, assisted by Edward H. Williams, is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The volume focuses on the aspects of recent science, exploring key developments and institutions that have shaped the field, particularly in the context of the 18th and 19th centuries. It provides a narrative of how science transitioned into modernity through notable personalities and institutions such as the British Museum and the Royal Society.  At the start of this volume, the author sets the stage for discussions on significant developments in the world of science, beginning with the founding of the British Museum. He elaborates on the circumstances that led to its establishment, including the lottery set up to fund its formation and the collections it amassed, notably those acquired from Sir Hans Sloane and Egyptian antiquities from Napoleon’s era. The narrative serves as an introduction to the evolution of institutions that play a pivotal role in scientific advancement, while also hinting at the cultural and social implications of scientific discovery that have persisted into modern times.
