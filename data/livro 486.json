    "resumo": "\"Queer Little Folks\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a collection of whimsical stories likely written in the late 19th century. The book features a variety of charming animal characters, such as Mrs. Feathertop the hen and her experience with an unexpected brood of ducklings, presenting engaging tales that highlight the quirks and personalities of its cast.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the delightful story of Mrs. Feathertop, a hen of good lineage who starts off seeming frivolous and unconcerned with family responsibilities. However, as she lays eggs and prepares for motherhood, the tale humorously unfolds the tensions between her and her neighbors, like the grumpy Mrs. Scratchard. Readers witness Mrs. Feathertop's transformation when she hatches a brood of ducklings amidst the chaos of gossiping neighbors and a well-meaning but somewhat oblivious husband, Mr. Gray Cock. This whimsical beginning sets the tone for charming anecdotes that both entertain and convey subtle messages about family life and community. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
