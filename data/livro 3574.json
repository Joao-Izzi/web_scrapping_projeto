    "resumo": "\"Abélard, Tome II\" by Charles de Rémusat is a philosophical treatise written during the mid-19th century. This work delves deeply into the metaphysical inquiries of the medieval thinker Peter Abelard, particularly focusing on the extensive and contentious debates surrounding the nature of universals – concepts that are abstract and apply to multiple instances, like \"humanity\" for individual humans. The narrative primarily explores the intellectual environment of Abelard's time, addressing various schools of thought regarding universals, including realism and nominalism.  The opening of the treatise sets the stage for discussing the long-lasting controversy over the nature of genres and species, emphasizing its abstract nature and the fervent debates it sparked over the centuries. It begins by citing historical sentiments from figures like Jean de Salisbury regarding the intensity of intellectual disputes surrounding the nature of universals. The section outlines different philosophical positions, primarily contrasting realism—the belief in the existence of universals as entities in their own right—with nominalism, which considers universals as mere names or labels lacking independent existence. This introduction establishes both the historical context and the philosophical stakes of the discussions that will unfold in the book. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
