The book centers around a set of twins, Count Luigi and Count Angelo Capello, who are physically connectedâ€”each possessing one half of a dual-headed body. The narrative humorously explores the complexities of their shared existence as they navigate society and personal relationships, relationship dynamics, and the misunderstandings that arise from their unusual condition.  The opening of the narrative sets the stage for the twins' arrival at the home of the Coopers, where Aunt Patsy and her daughter Rowena excitedly anticipate their new guests. As the twins arrive amidst a storm, they are met with shock and confusion due to their unique physicality. Comedic elements unfold as Aunt Patsy grapples with understanding their nature, leading to misunderstandings about identity and individuality.
