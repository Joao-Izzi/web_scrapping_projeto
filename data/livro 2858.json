    "resumo": "\"Christopher Columbus (1440–1506): The First American Citizen (by Adoption)\" by William L. Alden is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This biography explores the life of Christopher Columbus, delving into his early years, ambitions, and the voyages that led to the discovery of the Americas. Alden presents Columbus not merely as a renowned explorer but also takes a unique stance by suggesting he can be considered the first American citizen by adoption.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the complexities surrounding Columbus's birth and early life, highlighting the uncertain narratives surrounding his origins. Alden cleverly conveys the multiple claims to Columbus's birthplace and his early education and aspirations. The anecdotes about youthful adventures and misadventures provide insights into Columbus’s character and hint at the determination that would drive his later explorations. These early chapters set the stage for Columbus's aspirations to explore uncharted territories, as he begins to form ideas of sailing westward to find new lands, which would eventually lead to his historic voyages across the Atlantic.
