    "resumo": "\"How to Become Rich: A Treatise on Phrenology, Choice of Professions, and Matrimony\" by Prof. William Windsor, LL.B., Ph.D. is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work aims to explore the science of phrenology, linking it with career choices and marriage decisions to help individuals enhance their success and happiness in life. Windsor presents phrenology not merely as a set of techniques but as a valuable science that can guide personal development and professional fulfillment.  The opening of the treatise establishes Windsor's authority and intent, as he addresses the audience with a passionate plea to approach the subject of phrenology without preconceived notions. He categorizes the audience into three classes based on their familiarity with phrenology and sets up the framework for his discussion. Furthermore, he defines phrenology as the science of intelligence, outlining its potential to accurately assess character and capabilities through cranial examination. Windsor provides a preview of his subsequent lectures, promising practical insights into selecting careers and partners based on individual natural endowments and intelligences, ultimately suggesting that understanding one's own qualities is crucial for achieving personal and financial success.
