    "resumo": "\"Drug Supplies in the American Revolution\" by George B. Griffenhagen is a historical account written in the mid-20th century. This publication examines the challenges and issues surrounding the availability and distribution of medical supplies to the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. It explores the operational chaos faced by medical officers and the impact of supply shortages on the army's health care efforts throughout the conflict.  The opening of the text sets the stage for a thorough analysis of drug supply issues that arose as the American colonies broke away from British control. It highlights the initial disruption in supply chains as the colonies lost access to English pharmaceuticals, leading to severe shortages for military hospitals. The author discusses the early efforts of Massachusetts officials to establish a reliable supply of medicines, detailing the coordination struggles and the eventual reliance on captured British supply ships, which became a critical resource amidst the turmoil of war. This introduction offers a fascinating glimpse into the logistical complexities faced by the nascent American military and the medical professionals working to care for its soldiers.
