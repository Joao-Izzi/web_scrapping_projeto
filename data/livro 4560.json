    "resumo": "\"Chitra: Ein Spiel in einem Aufzug\" by Rabindranath Tagore is a lyrical play that was written during the early 20th century. The narrative is inspired by a story from the Indian epic Mahabharata, revolving around themes of love, identity, and societal expectations. The play explores the inner turmoil of Chitra, a princess who defies traditional gender roles and yearns for love while grappling with her own identity and the expectations placed upon her as a woman.  The story follows Chitra, who is raised as a son by her father, the king of Manipur, due to a prophecy that only sons will ensure the continuation of their lineage. She longs for the mighty warrior Arjuna but struggles with the limitations imposed on her as a woman. Disguised as a man, she approaches Arjuna to win his affection but faces rejection because of his vow of celibacy. As her yearning for love deepens, Chitra seeks help from the gods to obtain beauty and eventually confronts her true self and desires. The play culminates in a poignant exploration of love, sacrifice, and self-acceptance, illustrating Chitra's journey toward embracing her identity while challenging societal norms.
