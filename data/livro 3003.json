    "resumo": "\"The Thin Red Line\" by Arthur Griffiths is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set against the backdrop of mid-19th century Paris and revolves around the dark underbelly of society, specifically focusing on a murder that takes place in a gambling house called the Hôtel Paradis. The novel introduces key characters such as the unfortunate victim, Baron d'Enot, and Rupert Gascoigne, an Englishman who becomes embroiled in the investigation surrounding the murder.  The opening of the book sets a grim tone as it describes the seedy environment of Paris's Halles district, characterized by loafers and deceptive appearances. Early chapters unfold with the police's arrival at the Hôtel Paradis, where a man has been stabbed, igniting a murder investigation led by Commissary M. Bontoux. As the plot develops, Rupert Gascoigne is arrested and interrogated, vehemently denying his involvement in the crime while revealing his troubled background and tumultuous relationship with his wife. The story promises a blend of mystery, intrigue, and the complexities of human relationships woven into a narrative rich in historical detail, inviting readers interested in crime fiction set in an evocative past.
