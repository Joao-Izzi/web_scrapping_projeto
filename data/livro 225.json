    "resumo": "\"On the Mechanism of the Physiological Action of the Cathartics\" by John Bruce MacCallum is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the physiological effects of saline purgatives, exploring their mechanisms of action and how they influence intestinal movement and secretion. MacCallum's focus on the role of various salts and their effects showcases his expertise in the field of physiology.  The beginning of the work provides a comprehensive backdrop on MacCallum's life, detailing his background, education, and significant contributions to physiology, particularly regarding his research on cathartics. Upon establishing the context, the author outlines the premise that the pamphlet comprises a series of experiments investigating saline purgatives' actions, summarizing earlier research and introducing new findings. The text sets the stage for further exploration of specific experiments that measure the purgative effects of different salts on the intestines, focusing on their overall physiological responses.
