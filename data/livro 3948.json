    "resumo": "\"Daddy-Long-Legs\" by Jean Webster is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Jerusha Abbott, an orphan who is granted a unique opportunity to attend college thanks to an anonymous benefactor, whom she affectionately nicknames \"Daddy-Long-Legs.\" This tale unfolds through a series of letters that Jerusha writes to her unseen patron, providing insights into her life, her aspirations, and her imaginative spirit as she navigates her new world of education and personal growth.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Jerusha, the oldest orphan at the John Grier Home, who feels a mixture of trepidation and excitement as she contemplates her future. Following an unusually successful meeting with a Trustee, she learns that she has been selected for college, a chance she never dreamed she would receive. The opening sets the tone for Jerusha's charming and earnest letters to her benefactor, detailing her experiences in college life, the friends she makes, and her evolving identity as she distances herself from her past at the orphanage. Expect warmth, humor, and a profound exploration of social themes such as class and gender within the context of early 20th-century America. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
