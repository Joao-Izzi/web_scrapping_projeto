    "resumo": "\"Nederlandsche Sagen en Legenden\" by Josef Cohen is a collection of tales drawn from Dutch folklore, published in the early 20th century. The work aims to delve deep into the soul of Dutch folk traditions and storytelling, blending humor, sentiment, and a hint of the mysterious, while also acknowledging the cultural shifts that have challenged these narratives over time.  The opening of the book introduces a foreword by the author, reflecting on the importance of folklore and its embodiment of the human experience, heightened through storytelling, gestures, and tradition. The narrative then begins with the tale of \"Het Vrouwtje van Stavoren,\" depicting the proud and wealthy lady of Stavoren, who becomes consumed with greed. As she awaits the return of her ships filled with riches, she encounters a beggar in desperate need. Her refusal to help him leads to a dire curse that ultimately strips her of her wealth and forces her to face the consequences of her actions. The story serves as a poignant exploration of pride, empathy, and the consequences of oneâ€™s choices. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
