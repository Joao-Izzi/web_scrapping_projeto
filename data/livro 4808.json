    "resumo": "\"Iole\" by Robert W. Chambers is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story introduces us to Clarence Guilford, a poet living in a rustic setting with his eight daughters, who embody simplicity and natural beauty. Set against the backdrop of a changing society, the narrative explores themes of art, love, and the contrast between wealth and poverty.  At the start of the novel, we meet a conversation between a station-agent and a traveler named Briggs, who reveals details about Guilford's life and how he transformed his home into a creative haven for his daughters. The station-agent recounts Guilford's rise to literary fame and subsequent downfall, resulting in a financial crisis marked by a mortgage threat against his home. This conversation sets the stage for the arrival of George Wayne, who is tasked with dealing with the poet's precarious situation. As Wayne journeys to meet Guilford, he is met with a colorful portrait of the poet's life and the quirky, idyllic existence of the daughters, hinting at the entanglements of love, responsibility, and the need to confront the changing tides of society.
