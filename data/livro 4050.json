    "resumo": "\"Tales from Gorky\" by Maksim Gorky is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The book explores the harsh realities of life for the impoverished in Russia, particularly focusing on characters who are social outcasts and vagabonds. Gorky utilizes his own experiences as inspiration, embodying the struggles and resilience of those living on the fringes of society.  The opening of \"Tales from Gorky\" introduces readers to a group of three hungry vagrants making their way through the desolate steppe. They are characterized by their common plight of starvation and their shared bonds of misfortune. Among them is a soldier and a self-described student, who engage in a conversation about their woeful condition while facing the cruel realities of their journey. Their eventual encounter with a mysterious man adds a layer of tension, as hunger and desperation lead them to contemplate morally questionable decisions to survive. The prose vividly illustrates the struggles of the characters against a backdrop of bleak but beautiful Russian landscapes, setting the tone for the stories that follow.
