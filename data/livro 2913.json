    "resumo": "\"Bygone Scotland: Historical and Social\" by David Maxwell is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work explores the development of Scotland from ancient tribal roots to a more autonomous nation, detailing significant events and influences that shaped its history, including the Roman occupation, the rise of the Scottish nation, and the conflicts with England. The author focuses on the evolution of Scottish society and culture over the centuries, offering insights into the people and events that contributed to Scotland's identity.  The opening of the book introduces the context of Scotland's history by discussing the early inhabitants of Britain and their cultures before and during the Roman invasion. Maxwell highlights the transition from semi-barbarism to a more structured society under the Roman influence, illustrating how various tribes interacted with the Romans and with each other. He describes notable figures like Caractacus and Boadicea, detailing their resistance against Roman rule, and sets the stage for discussing the complexities of Scotland's historical narrative, emphasizing that this work will not be a chronological account but rather a series of thematic studies that reveal the interplay of Scottish and English histories over time.
