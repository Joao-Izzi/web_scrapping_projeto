    "resumo": "\"The Hero of Panama: A Tale of the Great Canal\" by F. S. Brereton is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is centered around Jim Partington, a young American boy who, after facing a series of misfortunes, embarks on a journey that eventually leads him to the construction efforts of the Panama Canal. As he navigates both the challenges of salvage work in the Caribbean and the trials of saving lives, the narrative promises themes of adventure, resilience, and the importance of friendship against the backdrop of a monumental engineering project.  At the start of the novel, we encounter Jim and his sister Sadie, who are involved in a salvage operation on their small ship. Through a vivid depiction of their surroundings and the characters aboard, including the cheerful negro Tom and the Chinaman Ching Hu, we learn about their daily life and the burden of responsibility thrust upon Jim after their father's death. Following a disastrous incident where their ship encounters trouble and a collision occurs, Jim demonstrates valor by diving into the sea to rescue a fellow passenger. This act of bravery sets in motion a series of events that takes Jim and his companions to Panama and the ambitious canal construction, hinting at the adventures and challenges that lie ahead as they seek to overcome their hardships.
