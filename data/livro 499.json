    "resumo": "\"The Story of Our Country\" by Jesse Lyman Hurlbut is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This book aims to narrate the history of the United States in a way that's accessible for younger readers, highlighting key figures, events, and the development of the nation from its early exploration to its rise as a prominent country.   The opening of the book sets a nostalgic tone by prompting readers to reflect on the transformation of the United States over a span of three hundred years. Hurlbut vividly describes the landscape of the early country, emphasizing the contrast between the wild beauty of the land before colonization and the bustling cities and farms that have since emerged. He introduces Christopher Columbus and his legendary voyage across the Atlantic, framing this as a pivotal moment that ignited the exploration and eventual establishment of settlements by Europeans. The narrative encourages readers to appreciate the remarkable journey of their nation while foreshadowing the challenges and triumphs that follow in the chapters about other explorers and pioneers.
