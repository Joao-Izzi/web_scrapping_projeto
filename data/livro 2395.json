    "resumo": "\"Raspberry Jam\" by Carolyn Wells is a fictional novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the characters Eunice Embury and her eccentric Aunt Abby Ames, who is excited about attending a performance by a man known as Hanlon, who claims to possess the extraordinary ability of mind-reading or telepathy. The novel hints at themes of family dynamics, skepticism towards the supernatural, and various social interactions.  At the start of the narrative, the scene is set in the luxurious New York apartment of the Emburys, presenting a lively and somewhat contentious dialogue between Eunice and Aunt Abby. Aunt Abby passionately stresses her desire to see Hanlon's performance, while Eunice expresses her disapproval and skepticism of both the event and her aunt’s interests in the occult. The characters’ personalities come through in their interaction, with Eunice being more practical and composed, in stark contrast to her aunt's whimsical enthusiasm. This introductory clash sets the stage for a story rich with character development and the exploration of belief versus skepticism as they navigate their social world surrounding the intriguing performance.
