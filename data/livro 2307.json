    "resumo": "\"Lord Alistair's Rebellion\" by Allen Upward is a novel written in the early 20th century. It presents a compelling narrative centered on Lord Alistair Stuart, a young man grappling with his failures and tumultuous relationship with the enigmatic Molly Finucane. As society watches from the sidelines, the story delves into themes of identity, morality, and the struggles against societal pressures within the backdrop of early 20th-century England.  At the start of the story, London is vividly described at night, mirroring the contrasts in Alistair's life as he stands on Westminster Bridge. He contemplates his failures and the burden of his familial legacy while external tensions reflect the divide between the affluent north bank and the deprived south. The narrative introduces Alistair as a man facing public disgrace over his bankruptcy, which coincides with the success of his brother, the Duke of Trent. Alistair is emotionally intertwined with Molly Finucane, a woman of dubious reputation, whose influence complicates his journey toward self-discovery and societal redemption. Their complex romance, coupled with familial expectations, sets the stage for the unfolding consequences of Alistair's choices as he seeks to understand his place in a world steeped in moral ambiguity.
