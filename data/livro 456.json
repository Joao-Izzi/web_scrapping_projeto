    "resumo": "\"The Gnome's Gneiss\" by Kendell Foster Crossen is a fantasy novelet written in the early 1950s. Set against the backdrop of an increasingly anxious post-World War II America, the narrative intertwines elements of mythology with humor, exploring themes of belief and diplomacy in a whimsical world where the Little People, such as gnomes and fairies, exist alongside humans. The story primarily revolves around the protagonist, Kevan MacGreene, who finds himself entangled in a fantastical adventure following his unexpected job with Troubleshooters, Inc.  In this tale, Kevan, after receiving a draft rejection due to his admission of hearing voices, is employed by a quirky organization that resolves issues between mortals and magical beings. His first assignment leads him into the enchanting realm of the Little People, where an irate gnome named Alviss seeks revenge for a destroyed piece of his artâ€”a gneiss he believes is vital to his honor. Alviss demands the return of Thrud, the daughter of Thor, as compensation to avert chaos that could threaten both their worlds. As Kevan navigates through various challenges, including persuading gods and resolving conflicts, he mingles with characters like Loki and finds a way to restore peace to the realm while uncovering deeper connections with his own reality. The adventure culminates in an unexpected twist, leaving Kevan with not only a fortune but a chance at romantic fulfillment as well. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
