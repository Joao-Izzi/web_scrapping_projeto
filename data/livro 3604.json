    "resumo": "\"Address: Centauri\" by F. L. Wallace is a science fiction novel likely written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around a group of accidentals—humans who have been severely injured and rendered partially non-functional—who live on an asteroid known as Handicap Haven. As they battle their confinement and seek a way to escape to the stars, the characters face not only external societal rejection but also confront their own physical limitations and desires for belonging and agency.  The opening of the novel introduces the main character, Doctor Cameron, as he navigates a difficult conversation with Docchi, a biocompensator, about the Solar Committee's refusal to let the accidentals leave their undesirable situation on the asteroid. Docchi expresses frustration over this decision, feeling a strong sense of spirit among his fellow accidentals, who are eager to prove their worth beyond their disabilities. Meanwhile, the reader is introduced to various characters, including Nona, Anti, and Jordan, who form a local recreation committee, indicating a growing discontent among their ranks. As the narrative unfolds, hints of rebellion and the characters’ resourcefulness begin to take shape, setting the stage for their quest to reach the nearest star systems against overwhelming odds.
