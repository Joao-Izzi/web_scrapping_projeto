This work delves into themes of personal memory and nostalgia, exploring the past through rich descriptions and emotional introspection. Lehtonen’s writing captures the beauty of rural Finnish life, the passage of time, and the connections between individuals and their surroundings.  The book is structured around evocative descriptions of memory-laden scenes from the author’s childhood and youth, depicting the simplicity and challenges of life in a Finnish village. It features stories of village life, community interactions, and the natural environment, interwoven with reflections on class distinctions and societal changes.
