    "resumo": "\"The Little Minister\" by J. M. Barrie is a novel written during the late 19th century. Set in the fictional Scottish village of Thrums, the story centers on Gavin Dishart, a young minister who is about to embrace his new position while navigating the complexities of love, duty, and social tensions within his community.  The opening of the novel introduces us to a reflective narrative style, as an unnamed dominie reminisces about the life of Gavin Dishart. We learn that Gavin, at just twenty-one, has arrived in Thrums full of hope and enthusiasm, along with his protective mother. Their arrival is juxtaposed with the poignant memory of unfulfilled love between a previous minister and the woman he never married. Gavin's character is portrayed as earnest and well-intentioned, but he is soon entwined in the lives of the townsfolk, and a hint of looming conflicts—both personal and societal—is introduced through his interactions. The narrative is rich with the local color of Thrums and sets the stage for the unfolding drama as Gavin encounters various characters, including an enigmatic Egyptian woman, hinting at the romantic and social challenges he will face.
