    "resumo": "\"Dispersão\" by Mário de Sá-Carneiro is a collection of 12 poems written during the early 20th century. The book delves into themes of existential introspection, emotional turmoil, and the human condition, reflecting the author's deep sense of longing and melancholy. It captures the essence of modernist literary movements, characterized by fragmented narratives and a focus on individual sentiment.  The poems of \"Dispersão\" explore the complexities of the poet's inner life, revealing a struggle with identity, memory, and a pervasive sense of loss. Through vivid imagery and evocative language, Sá-Carneiro presents a journey where he grapples with the fleeting nature of existence and the weight of unfulfilled desires. The poems reflect on themes of yearning for connection, the burden of self-awareness, and the beauty and tragedy found in the elusive quest for meaning. Ultimately, the collection paints a poignant portrait of the artist as both a seeker of truth and a sufferer of solitude in a rapidly changing world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
