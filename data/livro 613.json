    "resumo": "\"Roast Beef, Medium: The Business Adventures of Emma McChesney\" by Edna Ferber is a novel written during the early 20th century. The story revolves around Emma McChesney, a strong and independent traveling saleswoman for T. A. Buck's Featherloom Petticoats, who navigates the challenges of her profession with wit and tenacity while also reflecting on her personal life and maternal instincts.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Emma as she enjoys a solitary dinner in a small-town hotel, contemplating her work and the competitive nature of the retail industry. She reflects on her experiences as a traveling saleswoman, highlighted by her encounter with a handsome, young man, who is new to the business. The interaction leads Emma to impart some hard-earned wisdom about the realities of their jobs, while also wrestling with her reminiscences of home and motherhood. This opening sets the stage for a mix of humor and serious introspection as Emma balances her professional ambitions with her role as a mother to her teenage son, Jock.
