The story revolves around the lives of rural Irish characters, particularly focusing on social dynamics, familial relationships, and the challenges faced by those in the farming community. Early in the narrative, we are introduced to Peety Dhu, a mendicant, and his beautiful daughter, who visit the affluent farmer Jemmy Burke, setting the stage for themes of class disparity, ambition, and the pursuit of a better life.  The opening of the book presents a vivid picture of the rural Irish setting, establishing the dynamics of the Burke household contrasted with the modesty of Peety Dhu and his daughter.
