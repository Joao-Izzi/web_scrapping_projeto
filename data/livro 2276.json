    "resumo": "\"Sá de Miranda e a Sua Obra\" by Décio Carneiro is an analytical study written in the late 19th century. The work focuses on the life and contributions of the poet Sá de Miranda, who is recognized as a pivotal figure in the evolution of Portuguese literature during the 16th century. The book delves into his poetic works, his classical influences, and the impact he had on the literary landscape of Portugal.  The beginning of the text introduces the importance of earlier critical works on Sá de Miranda, particularly highlighting a biography that accompanied the second edition of his poetic works. It discusses the controversy over the authorship of this biography, asserting its significance as a foundational document for understanding Miranda's life and influence. Carneiro introduces the poet's connections to notable literary figures and examines how Sá de Miranda’s unique blend of classical and national poetic traditions laid the groundwork for future Portuguese literature. The opening provides a context for the ensuing exploration of Miranda's life, works, and his lasting impact on the literary culture in Portugal. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
