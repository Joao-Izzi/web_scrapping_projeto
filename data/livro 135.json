    "resumo": "\"Long Odds\" by Harold Bindloss is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Thomas Ormsgill, a determined Englishman navigating the challenges of life in colonial Africa, where he grapples with themes of duty, moral obligation, and personal redemption against a backdrop of harsh realities. As he seeks to fulfill a promise made to a deceased acquaintance, Ormsgill's journey explores the weight of responsibility in a land filled with corruption and struggle.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Commandant Dom Erminio at Fort San Roque, Western Africa, who reflects on the oppressive heat and the monotony of his surroundings. The arrival of Thomas Ormsgill and American missionary Watson Nares interrupts this monotony. Ormsgill is depicted as a man of strong will and compassion, determined to assist a sick colleague. The opening scenes reveal the precariousness of life in Africa, where Ormsgill navigates treacherous terrain both literally and morally. As he converses with the commandant and his companion, it becomes evident that his journey is not just about physical challenges but also explores deep questions of trust, loyalty, and moral responsibility.
