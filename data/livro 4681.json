    "resumo": "\"History of the Commune of 1871\" by Lissagaray is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book chronicles the events surrounding the Paris Commune, a radical socialist government that briefly ruled Paris following the Franco-Prussian War. Lissagaray aims to present an in-depth examination of the political struggle, the social transformations, and the eventual downfall of the Commune, providing valuable insight for anyone interested in revolutionary movements or French history.  The opening of the book sets the stage for the tumultuous events leading to the Commune, beginning with the disastrous military campaigns faced by France in the summer of 1870 and the political turmoil that ensued as a result. It describes the atmosphere in Paris as frustrations with the Imperial government build, with working-class citizens and intellectuals growing increasingly disillusioned and eager for change. The narrative captures the rising tensions, the shifting loyalties of various social classes, and the movements toward radical action that culminated in the eventual uprising and the establishment of the Commune. By illustrating these early moments of upheaval, Lissagaray establishes a critical context for the revolution itself, hinting at the complexities and conflicts that would define the Commune.
