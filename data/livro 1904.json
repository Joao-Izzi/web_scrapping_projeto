    "resumo": "\"Die Armen: Ein Roman\" by Heinrich Mann is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative delves into the struggles and complex lives of the working class, juxtaposing their plight against the backdrop of wealth and privilege represented by the bourgeois characters, particularly Professor Klinkorum and General Director He√üling. Central to the story are the characters Karl Balrich, a worker who grapples with the harsh realities of life, and the children surrounding the labor community, embodying both innocence and the consequences of their social environment.  The opening of the book vividly immerses readers in the chaotic life outside a large worker's house in Gausenfeld, with children playing and chaotic scenes reflecting the harsh realities of their existence. Through the lens of Balrich, who observes the disparity between his life and that of the affluent, readers are introduced to the layered dynamics of class, authority, and survival. The text captures the tension between the workers and the elite, showcased in Klinkorum's disdain for the workers contrasted with Balrich's acute awareness of his circumstances. The interactions among these characters highlight themes of social injustice, poverty, and the struggle for dignity in a world rife with economic disparity.
