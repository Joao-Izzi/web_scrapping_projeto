    "resumo": "\"Abbotsford\" by W. S. Crockett is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the life and legacy of Sir Walter Scott, particularly focusing on his iconic home, Abbotsford, located in the Scottish Borders. It delves into Scott's deep connection to the Border Country, his literary contributions, and the architectural evolution of Abbotsford itself.  The narrative unfolds in several chapters, beginning with Scott's arrival at the site of Abbotsford, where he dreamed of creating his own estate, and continuing through the construction and embellishment of the property. Crockett describes Scott's life at Abbotsford during its glorious years, filled with literary success and social gatherings, as well as the eventual decline and hardships he faced. The book highlights Scott's passion for tree planting, his close relationships with friends and servants, and the profound impact of his work on Scottish literature and landscape.
