    "resumo": "\"A Yellow Aster, Volume 3 (of 3)\" by Mrs. Mannington Caffyn is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds around the complexities of love, marriage, and personal identity, primarily focusing on the character Gwen Strange as she navigates her tumultuous relationship with her husband, Humphrey Strange. Set against a backdrop of societal expectations and personal struggles, the narrative delves into the emotional depths of motherhood, loss, and the search for self amidst external pressures.  At the start of the book, we see Gwen engaged in science experiments while navigating her feelings toward her husband after a near-tragic incident involving his bravery. Despite the weight of such dramatic events, Gwen feels emotionally disconnected, grappling with her own identity and societal roles. As she observes her husbandâ€™s heroism and their relationship dynamics, she is forced to confront her feelings of inadequacy and emotional turmoil. The reader is drawn into her internal conflict as she reflects on themes of love, sacrifice, and the weight of expectations, setting the stage for an exploration of deeper existential questions as the narrative progresses.
