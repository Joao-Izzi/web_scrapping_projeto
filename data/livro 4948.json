    "resumo": "\"The Fauna of the Deep Sea\" by Sydney J. Hickson is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The book focuses on the mysteries of deep-sea life, exploring the various forms of animal life that exist at great depths in the ocean and the physical conditions of their habitats. It aims to consolidate significant findings from previous scientific expeditions and provide insights into the evolution and adaptations of deep-sea organisms.  At the start of the book, Hickson discusses humanity's historical ignorance regarding deep-sea life, contrasting past beliefs that the ocean's depths were lifeless with more recent discoveries confirming the abundance of diverse organisms in extreme environments. He outlines the pioneering investigations that revealed the existence of deep-sea fauna, such as those conducted by the H.M.S. Challenger and other expeditions. The opening portion sets the stage for further exploration of the characteristics, physical conditions, and origins of deep-sea organisms, establishing a foundation for the detailed discussions that follow in subsequent chapters.
