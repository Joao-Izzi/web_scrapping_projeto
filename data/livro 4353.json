    "resumo": "\"Pig-Headed\" Sailor Men by Louis Becke is a collection of maritime anecdotes that highlights the stubbornness and incompetence observed in ship captains, written during the early 20th century. The book recounts the author's personal experiences at sea, particularly his encounters with obstinate and incapable captains in the South Sea trade. This collection offers a unique glimpse into maritime life, filled with humor and tragedy stemming from the often pig-headed nature of sailors.  In the book, Becke shares several colorful tales revolving around various vessels, beginning with his journey on the barque \"Rimitara\", captained by the skilled but dismissive Captain Rosser. As he travels, he details specific incidents involving captains who disregard sound navigational advice, leading to perilous situationsâ€”including a disastrous grounding and shipwreck. The stories showcase a range of characters, from the blundering captain of the brigantine \"Tuitoga\" to the self-assured yet reckless Captain Evers of the barquentine \"George Noble\". Each narrative serves to illustrate the consequences of a sailor's pride and obstinacy while simultaneously capturing the unpredictable nature of life at sea.
