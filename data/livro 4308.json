    "resumo": "\"Spiritual Torrents\" by Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon is a spiritual treatise written in the late 17th century. The text explores the various ways in which individuals seek communion with God, detailing a progression through differing states of prayer and spiritual experience. The author emphasizes the importance of relinquishing self-reliance and abandoning oneself entirely to God's will for spiritual growth.  The opening of \"Spiritual Torrents\" introduces the notion that souls under divine influence have an innate desire to return to God, which can manifest in different ways likened to streams and rivers. Guyon divides the journey towards God into three classes: the active, meditative approach; the passive way of light; and ultimately the more profound passive way of faith. The author cautions that while all souls might seek perfection, their paths, experiences, and the resultant closeness to God differ significantly, with some rushing along tumultuous torrents, while others flow slowly and quietly. Each class represents a different phase of spiritual development, characterized by struggles with self, worldly distractions, and the challenges of surrendering to divine guidance.
