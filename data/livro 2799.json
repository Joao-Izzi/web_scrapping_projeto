    "resumo": "\"Pillars of Society\" by Henrik Ibsen is a play in four acts written during the late 19th century. The narrative unfolds in a small coastal town in Norway, centering on the character of Karsten Bernick, a shipbuilder whose seemingly successful life is complicated by the return of family members and the re-emergence of a scandal from his past. The play explores themes of morality, societal expectations, and the impact of personal choices on public reputation.  The opening of \"Pillars of Society\" introduces us to the Bernick household, where Mrs. Bernick hosts a gathering of local ladies who are engaged in charitable work. The atmosphere is disrupted when Aune, an employee at the shipyard, learns that Bernick has forbidden him from speaking out against the negative impacts of modernization on workers. Meanwhile, discussions about the potential railway project and a scandal involving Bernick's brother-in-law set the stage for the ensuing drama. As characters casually reference the past and engage in moral discussions, the tension between personal desires and societal expectations becomes apparent, hinting at deeper conflicts ahead. The stage is set for an exploration of the complexities of human relationships and the masks people wear in the name of respectability. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
