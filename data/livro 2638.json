    "resumo": "\"Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque, Volume 2\" by Fani Parks is a travel narrative written in the mid-19th century. This work chronicles the author’s extensive explorations and experiences over twenty-four years throughout the East, particularly focusing on the life and customs observed in various cultural settings. The narrative primarily revolves around the lives of zenāna women, offering insights into their existence against the backdrop of the colorful tapestry of Eastern society.  The opening of the narrative introduces the reader to a series of vivid and detailed descriptions of the Mahratta Camp and its zenāna, particularly emphasizing the life of Her Highness the Bāiza Bā’ī, the widow of a former ruler, who navigates her day-to-day life in a complex societal structure. The chapter begins with the Pilgrim arriving at Fathīghar, where he encounters the Bā’ī and reflects on the fluctuating fortunes of the nobility amid political unrest. The author’s experiences include sharing musical moments, engaging in discussions about cultural customs, and vivid portrayals of the characters he meets, such as the young Gaja Rājā and her ladies—all while contrasting their lives with European norms, which serve as points of comparison throughout the text. The narrative combines personal anecdotes with broader discussions of cultural practices, artistry, and the socio-political climate of the time. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
