    "resumo": "\"Woman under Socialism\" by August Bebel is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work presents a critical examination of the social conditions and oppression faced by women, particularly within a capitalist framework, arguing for their liberation as a vital step towards social equality for all. Bebelâ€™s discourse is set against the backdrop of a growing socialist movement and offers a thorough analysis of gender dynamics, class struggles, and the need for a transformational social structure.  At the start of the text, Bebel introduces the central theme of the \"Woman Question,\" emphasizing the urgent need for women to achieve equal rights and dignity in society. He asserts that women's subjugation is not a natural condition but a product of social structures that have evolved over time. Through a historical lens, he examines the roles and statuses of women across various stages of civilization, from the matriarchal societies of the past to the patriarchal systems of his own time. Bebel argues that just as the working class must seek to overthrow capitalism, women must unite with this struggle to break free from their bondage and achieve genuine equality.
