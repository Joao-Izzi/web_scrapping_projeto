    "resumo": "\"Prince Prigio\" by Andrew Lang is a fantasy novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the titular character, Prince Prigio, who is portrayed as excessively clever, leading to both admiration and disdain from those around him. As he navigates his royal duties and the expectations of his family, he becomes embroiled in whimsical adventures that involve magical creatures and fairy tale elements.  At the start of the tale, we are introduced to an ancient kingdom called Pantouflia, where King Grognio and Queen Zaza desire a child. When they finally have a son, Prigio, the fairies who usually bless royal children were not invited to the christening due to the queen's disbelief in them. As a result, Prigio grows up incredibly intelligent but is misunderstood and disliked by many, including his own father. The prince eventually faces trials including battles with fantastical creatures like the Firedrake, while dealing with the repercussions of his intellect and the royal family's expectations. The narrative sets up themes of cleverness, the nature of belief, and the challenges of living up to greatness, captivating readers with its charm and humor.
