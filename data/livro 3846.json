    "resumo": "\"La Grande Marnière\" by Georges Ohnet is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set amidst the lush landscapes of Normandy and chiefly revolves around the characters of Mlle de Clairefont, an elegant young woman with a hint of melancholy, and Pascal Carvajan, a newcomer who has ties to a family at odds with hers. The narrative hints at themes of love, ambition, and class conflict as the two main characters navigate their complex social landscape.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the picturesque setting of a Normandy summer afternoon, where Mlle de Clairefont, a horse-riding amazone, encounters Pascal Carvajan, who is lost and seeks her direction. Their initial meeting is charged with tension as societal divides begin to show, especially when the revelation of their identities brings a swift end to their charming interaction. As Pascal grapples with this newfound connection, hints of hostility between their families bubble beneath the surface, setting the stage for a conflict that intertwines personal and broader social stakes. Their relationship is complicated further by the social expectations and familial histories entrenched in their lives, suggesting that their paths may lead toward inevitable confrontation and drama.
