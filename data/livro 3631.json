    "resumo": "\"The Bible, Douay-Rheims, Book 73: Apocalypse\" is a religious text categorized as a sacred scripture, representing one of the books of the New Testament traditionally attributed to St. John the Apostle. This book was likely written in the late 1st century, a period marked by the early Christian church's struggles and the Roman Empire's influence. The Apocalypse, also known as the Book of Revelation, deals with prophetic revelations concerning the end times, the final judgment, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.  The narrative unfolds through a series of visions presented to St. John while in exile on the island of Patmos. It begins with letters to seven churches in Asia, offering both commendation and admonition. These messages highlight the challenges faced by early Christians, including persecution and doctrinal confusion. The book transitions into vivid apocalyptic imagery, featuring symbols like the four horsemen, the beast, and the fall of Babylon, each representing greater spiritual and moral truths. As the narrative progresses, it emphasizes themes of judgment, redemption, and the promise of a new heaven and a new earth, culminating in the vision of the heavenly Jerusalem, where God dwells with humanity, free from sorrow and evil.
