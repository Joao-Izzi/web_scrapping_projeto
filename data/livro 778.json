    "resumo": "\"Noémie Hollemechette: Journal d'une petite réfugiée belge\" by Du Genestoux is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book captures the personal experiences of Noémie, a young Belgian girl, as her life is abruptly changed by the outbreak of World War I and the subsequent refugee crisis. The narrative allows readers to see the impact of war through the eyes of a child, highlighting themes of innocence, family bonds, and the heart-wrenching displacement caused by conflict.\"  \"At the start of the narrative, Noémie begins her journal in July 1914, excited about her impending summer vacation and the joy of spending time with family at the seaside. However, as tensions rise in her homeland, the joyous anticipation quickly shifts to anxiety and fear, culminating in her brother Désiré's conscription into the military after the declaration of war. Through child-like reflections on her surroundings, her relationships with relatives, and her emotional responses to the unfolding crisis, the opening establishes the sharp contrast between the carefree innocence of childhood and the harsh realities of a nation facing invasion.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
