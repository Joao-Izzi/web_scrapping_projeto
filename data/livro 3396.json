    "resumo": "\"Titus Andronicus\" by William Shakespeare is a tragedy written in the late 16th century. The play explores themes of revenge, political strife, and the consequences of war, largely focusing on the character of Titus Andronicus, a Roman general returning home from a victorious campaign. As he faces treachery and betrayal, the narrative unfolds into a harrowing tale of grief and vengeance amidst a backdrop of Roman grandeur and barbarism.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to the political landscape of Rome, with Saturninus and Bassianus vying for the imperial crown. Following the return of Titus Andronicus, a celebrated military leader, the tension escalates as he must navigate the political machinations surrounding him, including the appeal of his daughter Lavinia and the exotic yet dangerous Tamora, the Queen of the Goths. The opening scenes establish the somber mood with a focus on themes of fate and familial loyalty, as Titus grapples with the losses of his sons and the demands of a political role that may not befit him, thus foreshadowing the tragic events that will ensue.
