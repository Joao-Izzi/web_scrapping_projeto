    "resumo": "\"Memoirs of a Midget\" by Walter De la Mare is a novel written in the early 20th century. This unique story follows the life of Miss M., a woman of diminutive stature, as she navigates her existence in a world that often perceives her physical size as a limitation. Through her reflections, Miss M. explores the complexities of her identity, her relationships, and the social perceptions connected to her height.  The opening of the novel begins with an introduction from the editor, who reveals their relationship with Miss M. and their role in bringing her memoirs to publication. The editor describes Miss M. as a unique character, deeply introspective and articulate about her experiences. As the narrative unfolds, readers are introduced to her upbringing in the picturesque village of Lyndsey and the people in her life, particularly her loving but perplexed mother and her indulgent father. The early chapters reveal Miss M.'s memories and her observations on her unusual stature, setting the stage for the broader exploration of themes such as individuality, societal expectations, and existential musings throughout her memoirs.   This beginning hints at a richly layered exploration of a character who challenges the reader's understanding of normalcy and identity through her poignant and sometimes humorous lens.
