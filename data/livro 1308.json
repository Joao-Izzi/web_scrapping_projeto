    "resumo": "\"Lord Lister No. 0306: Een avontuur van Koning Alfonso\" by Theo von Blankensee et al. is a fictional work written in the early 20th century. The narrative follows an enigmatic character, John Raffles, as he navigates a world filled with intrigue, danger, and the criminal underworld. The story begins with a mysterious incident in a hospital involving a severely wounded man and a series of sinister events that unfold, setting the stage for Raffles and his allies to get involved.  The opening portion of the tale introduces readers to a shocking event in a hospital where a man named Dubois has been fatally wounded under suspicious circumstances, drawing the attention of both the police and various nefarious individuals. As chaos ensues, two so-called detectives are arrested, only to later turn out to be dangerous criminals. Raffles learns about the gravity of the situation from Marthe Debussy, the injured man's lover, and vows to protect her and save Dubois, whose real identity is later revealed. The chapter closes with Raffles preparing a daring rescue plan that hints at a much larger conspiracy involving figures from the criminal underbelly of London and beyond.
