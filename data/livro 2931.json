    "resumo": "\"Sugar Plum\" by Reginald Bretnor is a science fiction short story published in the early 1950s. Set in the year 2189, the narrative follows Charles Edward Button, who whimsically announces to his wife and cousin that he has purchased an uninhabited Class IV planet named Sugar Plum. The story explores themes of societal expectations, the clash between Victorian ideals and modernity, and the notion of personal freedom in an alternate reality that juxtaposes past values with future possibilities.  The storyline unfolds as Charles and his family venture to their new planet, only to discover it is inhabited by bizarre yet endearing creatures and its previous owner, Captain Alexander Burgee, who reveals himself as an ex-pirate. The tale highlights the family's humorous interactions with their odd surroundings and each other, particularly the comedic and often absurd challenges posed by Cousin Aurelia, who embodies Old World conservatism. The central conflict arises from Burgee's unexpected claim to the planet, leading to amusing escapades as they all navigate the uncannily liberating and uninhibited nature of Sugar Plum, ultimately resulting in a transformation in their characters and attitudes.
