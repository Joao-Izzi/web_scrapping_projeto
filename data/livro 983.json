    "resumo": "\"The Sea-Hawk\" by Rafael Sabatini is a historical novel crafted in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around Sir Oliver Tressilian, a man of nobility who has become a notorious pirate on the Spanish Main, experienced in adventure and leadership, yet caught in a turbulent world of love, betrayal, and revenge.

Their conversation escalates into fierce verbal sparring, revealing tensions over past grievances and Peter's resentment towards Oliver's burgeoning relationship with Rosamund. The opening chapters set the stage for conflict, showcasing Oliver's fierce spirit and the complexities of familial loyalty, ultimately foreshadowing the tragic events that will arise from their strained dynamics as the story unfolds.
