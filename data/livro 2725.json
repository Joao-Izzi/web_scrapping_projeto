    "resumo": "\"The Box of Whistles\" by John Norbury is an illustrated publication on organ cases written in the late 19th century. This work delves into both the aesthetic and mechanical aspects of organs, providing insights on the design and construction of organ cases from various cultures. The book appears to be a valuable resource for musicians, builders, architects, and enthusiasts interested in the history and intricacies of organ design.  The opening of the book introduces the author's personal connection to the organ, notably the one at St. Paul's Cathedral, which inspired his interest in the subject. Norbury expresses his intention not to provide technical instructions for playing or building organs, but to offer descriptions of organ cases that could inspire future improvements and appreciation for this complex instrument. He discusses the organ's appeal to musicians, mechanics, and architects, highlighting the rich interplay of sound and design that characterizes organs worldwide.
