    "resumo": "\"Charles Sumner: his complete works, volume 15 (of 20)\" by Charles Sumner is a historical collection of speeches and writings penned in the mid-19th century. The volume chiefly focuses on key political issues surrounding American foreign relations and domestic policies in a critical era of American history, particularly relating to the cession of Russian America. Sumner, a prominent abolitionist and senator, is known for his eloquent advocacy for civil rights and foreign policy reform, making his speeches significant for understanding the political landscape of the time.  At the start of this volume, the opening section captures insights from a pivotal speech delivered by Sumner on April 9, 1867, advocating for the ratification of the treaty that ceded Russian America to the United States. It details the unfolding of events leading to the treaty, including discussions with key political figures and the rationale behind Sumner's support. He emphasizes the treaty's implications for American territory, the relationship with Russia, and broader themes of democracy and civil rights. The text underscores Sumner's belief that the acquisition is not merely about territory but also about fostering unity and extending republican ideals in the Americas.
