    "resumo": "\"An Account of the Battle of Châteauguay\" by W.D. Lighthall is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This book chronicles the significant military engagement during the War of 1812, which took place at Châteauguay, Quebec. The work serves not only as a detailed examination of the battle itself but also aims to promote Canadian nationalism by emphasizing the importance of this event in the context of Canadian history.  The book presents a comprehensive narrative of the Battle of Châteauguay, highlighting the pivotal role played by Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salaberry and his Canadian Voltigeurs in defending against the American forces led by General Wade Hampton. Lighthall meticulously recounts the strategies employed by de Salaberry, such as the use of defensive fortifications and psychological tactics like the ruse of multiple bugle calls to create the illusion of a larger force. The text details the events of October 26, 1813, capturing the intensity of the skirmish and the valor shown by both Canadian troops and indigenous allies. Ultimately, the battle resulted in a significant Canadian victory that bolstered morale and unity amid external threats, illustrating themes of courage, patriotism, and the defense of home.
