    "resumo": "\"The Hardy Country: Literary Landmarks of the Wessex Novels\" by Charles G. Harper is a literary exploration and guide written in the early 20th century. This work discusses the geographical and cultural landscapes that inspired Thomas Hardy's famous Wessex novels, particularly focusing on the rural regions of Dorsetshire. Harper provides insights into the real-life locations correlating with characters and events found in Hardy's stories, inviting readers to appreciate the beauty and charm of this literary region.  The opening of the book establishes a vivid depiction of Dorsetshire, portraying it as an idyllic setting rich in pastoral beauty, with quaint customs and enduring rural traditions. Harper introduces the concept of \"Hardy Country,\" emphasizing the strong connection between Hardy's narratives and the actual places he famously depicted, such as Dorchester and Egdon Heath. He expresses a sense of personal exploration and admiration for the landscapes, recounting encounters with notable Hardy characters as though they are reflections of actual people he met.
