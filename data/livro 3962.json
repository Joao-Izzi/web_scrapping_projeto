    "resumo": "\"Imperfectly Proper\" by Peter Donovan is a collection of humorous sketches written in the early 20th century. The book presents satirical observations on modern life, middle-class values, and the quirks of society, with a focus on the humorous misadventures of its characters, particularly a man who is often put in amusing situations through his interactions with friends and societal norms.  At the start of the book, readers are introduced to Algie, an amateur sailor whose attempts at hosting a motorboat picnic go terribly wrong. His well-meaning, but misguided efforts lead to comedic disasters on the water, as he struggles with a malfunctioning boat and unpredictable weather, ultimately resulting in an embarrassing and wet return to shore. Donovan's light-hearted prose captures the essence of urban hilarity and societal observation, as the narrator reflects on the absurdities of modern life while engaging his friends in a mix of camaraderie and mischief that sets the stage for further humorous tales.
