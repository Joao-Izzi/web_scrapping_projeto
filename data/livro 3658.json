    "resumo": "\"Dark Hollow\" by Anna Katharine Green is a novel written during the early 20th century. The story begins in a small town where the respected Judge Ostrander has maintained an eerie isolation from society following a series of personal tragedies. The narrative centers around the mysterious events surrounding his home and the appearance of a veiled woman who enters his property, stirring up curiosity and concern among the townsfolk. As tensions rise, the community grapples with the implications of her presence and the judge's reclusive nature.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the local gossip surrounding Judge Ostrander's home, which has remained closed off to the public for years. The opening scene highlights a small group of townspeople who notice the judge's gate ajar, an unusual occurrence that prompts speculation about the sudden intrusion. Amidst the commotion, a man named Bela, who serves as the judge's loyal caretaker, is mentioned as a central figure. The townspeople recall the judge's past sorrows, including the loss of his son and a close friend, setting the stage for the unfolding drama. Tension builds as the community decides to intrude upon the judge's sanctuary, ultimately discovering him in a cataleptic state while questions about the mysterious woman linger in the air. The opening chapters effectively set the tone for a story filled with intrigue, emotion, and the complexities of human relationships. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
