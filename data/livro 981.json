    "resumo": "\"Garrity's Annuities\" by David Mason is a science fiction story crafted in the mid-20th century. It revolves around the unconventional life choices of a young space engineer named Garrity, who devises a plan to marry multiple women across different planets to maximize his happiness while minimizing expenses. The narrative explores themes of love, relationships, and the complications that arise from Garrity's scheme, set against a futuristic backdrop of interplanetary travel and diverse cultures.  The story follows Garrity and his cynical views on relationships as he prepares to marry several women in various ports, believing this strategy will provide him with the stability and emotional fulfillment he seeks. The plot thickens as Garrity marries the same woman—Katha—several times across different planet stops, though he remains oblivious to the fact that all his wives are, in fact, the same person with slight variations. The humor and irony of Garrity’s situation unfold through the eyes of a friend who witnesses the unfolding drama. This friend grapples with the surreal nature of Garrity's life, ultimately reflecting on the themes of perception and the complexity of love in an ever-expanding universe.
