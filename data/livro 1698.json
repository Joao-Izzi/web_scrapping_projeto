    "resumo": "\"On Liberty\" by John Stuart Mill is a philosophical essay written in the mid-19th century. The work primarily discusses the nature and limits of civil or social liberty, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom against societal authority. Mill seeks to establish a framework that protects individuality and self-expression, which he argues are essential for human progress.  The opening of the essay introduces Mill's exploration of the concept of liberty, contrasting it with authority and addressing the historical struggle between individual rights and government control. He highlights the evolution of societal views on governance and individualism, arguing that the necessity for society to impose restrictions on personal freedom must be strictly justified. Mill asserts that interference should only occur to prevent harm to others, emphasizing the sovereignty of the individual over their own body and mind. This sets the stage for his broader discussions on the rights of individuals and the role of society in governing conduct, making a compelling case for the protection of personal liberties in the face of societal pressures.
