    "resumo": "\"Luther, vol. 5 of 6\" by Hartmann Grisar is a scholarly examination of Martin Luther's life and teachings, written in the early 20th century. This volume, part of a comprehensive six-part biography, focuses on the ethical results of Luther's theological views and explores his moral teachings, their contradictions, and their implications during his life. The book delves into Luther’s interaction with various theological movements and prominent figures of his time, reflecting on the deep impact his ideas had on Christianity.  The opening of the volume introduces the overall themes and presents Luther's ethical framework, significantly shaped by his doctrine of justification by faith. Grisar reveals the complexity of Luther's moral teachings, noting that while he asserted the importance of good works, he simultaneously emphasized that true morality stemmed from a believer's certainty of salvation. Despite grappling with the reality of sin and the devil's influence, Luther’s views promoted an active struggle against one’s own sinful nature, indifference, and temptation. The text sets the stage for an examination of Luther’s responses to emerging theological challenges, highlighting his eagerness to clarify and defend his beliefs against misinterpretation and radical applications of his doctrine.
