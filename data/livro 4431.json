    "resumo": "\"Etruscan Tomb Paintings, Their Subjects and Significance\" by Frederik Poulsen is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the artistic and cultural elements of Etruscan tomb paintings, exploring their themes and the context in which they were created. Poulsen aims to provide insights into the significance of these paintings, which feature prominently in Etruscan burial customs and social practices.  The opening of the text introduces the reader to the challenges faced by archaeologists and historians in studying Etruscan tomb art, particularly focusing on the preservation and publication issues surrounding these works. Poulsen discusses early archaeological efforts in Etruria, detailing the experiences of explorers like Baron Stackelberg, who documented tomb paintings amidst the threat of deterioration due to environmental factors. As he sets the stage for the in-depth analysis to follow, the author establishes the need for more accurate reproductions of the original artworks and aims to investigate how these visual narratives reflect Etruscan society, religious practices, and their interactions with Greek influences, signaling an exploration of both the artistic evolution and cultural implications of Etruscan funerary art.
