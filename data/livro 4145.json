    "resumo": "\"The Necromancers\" by Robert Hugh Benson is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative begins with Mrs. Baxter, a devout widow, who is troubled by her son Laurie's recent romantic entanglements and his transition into Catholicism. Following the death of Amy Nugent, Laurie’s love interest, the stage is set for emotional turmoil as the characters grapple with themes of grief, morality, and the supernatural. The opening introduces characters that reflect contrasting perspectives on love, loss, and the afterlife, particularly highlighting the tension between tradition and emerging beliefs surrounding necromancy.  At the start of the story, we find Mrs. Baxter expressing her distress over her son's love life while lamenting the potential consequences of his choices. She is preoccupied with Laurie's grief following Amy's death and is concerned about his spiritual journey. Meanwhile, Maggie, the girl who listens to Mrs. Baxter's concerns and shares her thoughts, subtly critiques Laurie's decisions and reflects on the selfishness behind his romantic pursuits. The chapter unfolds to reveal Laurie’s inner turmoil, deepened by the weight of his grief and his desperation for a connection to Amy even after her death. This complex emotional landscape sets the stage for the exploration of themes like the intersection of love and death, the search for meaning, and the potential for connecting with lost loved ones beyond the grave.
