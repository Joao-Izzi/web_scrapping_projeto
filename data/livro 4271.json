    "resumo": "\"English and Scottish Ballads, Volume VIII\" by Francis James Child is a collection of traditional ballads written in the mid-19th century. This volume continues an exploration of folk narratives and songs from England and Scotland, featuring a variety of tales that often include themes of love, trickery, and moral lessons. The ballads are rich with historical context and showcase the oral storytelling traditions of the time.  The opening of this volume presents \"King John and the Abbot of Canterbury,\" a comedic tale involving a contest of wits between King John and the Abbot. The king confronts the abbot about his lavish spending and challenges him to answer three riddles, using clever humor to explore themes of power and cleverness. The abbot, initially at a loss, seeks help from his shepherd, who ultimately disguises himself to save the abbot from execution. This narrative sets the tone for a collection filled with engaging stories that reflect social dynamics and the wit of the common people. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
