    "resumo": "\"World Edge\" by Jack Egan is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. The book explores themes of reality, memory, and identity as it follows the protagonist, Harvey Crane, who finds himself in a surreal landscape filled with fantastical elements, including otherworldly creatures and an enigmatic girl named Dana. The story delves into Harvey's struggle to understand his existence and the nature of the world around him.  In \"World Edge,\" Harvey Crane awakens in a strange and colorful world with little recollection of his past, accompanied by a girl named Dana and a shape-shifting creature. As he navigates this peculiar reality, he begins to uncover the truth about his situation: he is trapped in a dreamlike state following an accident in his spaceship that sent him into an alternate dimension. Dana reveals herself to be a projection of his subconscious, representing his wife on Earth, and urges him to wake up and confront reality. The narrative culminates in a tense confrontation between Harvey's desire to remain in this fantasy world and the pressing need to return to the real world, ultimately lending itself to a profound reflection on the nature of existence and imagination.
