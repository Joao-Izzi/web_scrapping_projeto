    "resumo": "\"The Ghost: A Modern Fantasy\" by Arnold Bennett is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Carl Foster, a young man with aspirations of becoming a doctor, who is introduced to the glamorous yet complex world of opera and theatrical fame in London through his cousin Sullivan. As Carl navigates this new landscape, he becomes entangled with notable characters such as the celebrated soprano Rosetta Rosa and the renowned tenor Alresca, who is suffering from a mysterious ailment.  The opening of the novel sets the stage for Carl's journey by depicting his innocent confusion and naivety as he arrives in London. He bumps into his older cousin Sullivan, who embodies the essence of theatricality, and invites Carl to join him at a prestigious opera performance. Through a series of interactions, Carl meets various influential people, including Sullivan's wife, Emmeline, who hints at deeper, more disconcerting undercurrents involving Rosa and Alresca. The narrative introduces themes of ambition, unrequited love, and the potentially sinister influence of fame, providing a tantalizing glimpse into a world where beauty and talent might mask underlying darkness.
