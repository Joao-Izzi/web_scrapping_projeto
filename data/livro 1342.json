    "resumo": "\"Les cotillons célèbres\" by Émile Gaboriau is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. The work explores the lives and influence of famous women, particularly the mistresses of French monarchs throughout history. The narrative likely aims to reclaim the reputations of these women, emphasizing their political significance and the misconceptions surrounding their legacies in popular literature.  The opening of the novel introduces the author's intention to restore the true identities of historical figures, especially those who have been misrepresented in drama and fiction. Gaboriau reflects on how the mistresses of French kings wielded power and shaped political landscapes through their relationships, beginning with examples from the Merovingian dynasty. The text hints at the story's focus on notable figures, such as Frédégonde and Agnès Sorel, framing these women not merely as romantic interests but as powerful influencers in their eras, thus setting the stage for a more nuanced perspective of their roles in history.
