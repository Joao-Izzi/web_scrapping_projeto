    "resumo": "\"The Secret Places of the Heart\" by H. G. Wells is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Sir Richmond Hardy, a man immersed in the complexities of modern society and struggling with his mental state amidst the pressures of his work on the Fuel Commission. The opening chapters explore themes of psychological turmoil, social responsibility, and the search for personal fulfillment against the backdrop of a world transformed by war and civil unrest.  The opening of the novel introduces Sir Richmond Hardy as he consults Dr. Martineau about his feelings of mental fatigue and anxiety related to his work. During their conversation, Sir Richmond expresses a deep sense of urgency regarding the potential collapse of society due to economic and social instability, revealing his worries about the motives of those around him. The doctor encourages him to engage in self-reflection rather than seeking a quick-fix solution through medication.
