    "resumo": "\"Tired Church Members\" by Anna Bartlett Warner is a religious commentary written during the late 19th century. The book delves into the spiritual fatigue that church members experience and critiques modern practices regarding recreation, entertainment, and the moral implications these carry for Christians. The text serves as a guide for navigating the complex relationship between faith and leisure in a way that honors Christian values.  In the book, Warner argues against various forms of entertainment, such as theatre-going and card games, presenting them as distractions that can lead Christians away from their spiritual commitments. She emphasizes the importance of aligning one's recreational activities with spiritual principles, advocating instead for pursuits that nurture the soul and enhance one's relationship with God. Through discussions on music, dance, and the concept of feasting, Warner invites readers to consider how their choices in leisure reflect their faith, ultimately portraying a vision of recreation not as a departure from God, but as a means of rejuvenation and service within a Christian framework.
