    "resumo": "\"An Essay on Comedy and the Uses of the Comic Spirit\" by George Meredith is a scholarly exploration of comic literature and its relevance to human society, written in the late 19th century. The text delves into the complexities and rarefied nature of true comedy, discussing the societal conditions that foster the comic spirit and the challenges faced by comic poets. Meredith contrasts various comedic traditions, analyzing the societal structures that both stifle and illuminate the comedic experience.  The opening of the essay begins by outlining the rarity of true comedies, suggesting that many recognized as such may not fulfill their potential. Meredith introduces the reader to the idea that a rich intellectual environment is necessary for comedy to flourish, while he criticizes the dichotomy between \"non-laughers,\" who reject humor altogether, and \"over-laughers,\" who laugh inappropriately. He argues that the true comic spirit serves as a critical lens on society, illuminating folly and moral failures while offering insight into the human condition. By invoking the works of great comic poets like Moliere and illustrating the evolution of comedic styles, the opening positions comedy as both a mirror and a critique of social norms, laying the foundation for a deeper exploration of its functions in later sections.
