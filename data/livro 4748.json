    "resumo": "\"Half-Hours with the Idiot\" by John Kendrick Bangs is a collection of humorous essays written in the early 20th century. The book features a central character known as the Idiot, who engages in witty dialogues with various acquaintances, discussing absurdities in society and politics. Through satire, the Idiot explores themes of architecture, gender roles, and the irritations of modern life, illuminating the quirks of human behavior.  At the start of the narrative, the Idiot and his friends engage in a comedic discussion about the disparity in the living conditions of American ambassadors in foreign capitals. The Idiot criticizes the uneven standards and suggests that the United States should build standardized residences for its diplomats, which prompts a humorous back-and-forth about American identity and architecture. This introductory conversation sets the tone for the witty and satirical observations that characterize the remainder of the text. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
