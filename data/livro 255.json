    "resumo": "\"L'Odyssée\" by Homer is an ancient epic poem likely written in the 8th century BC. The narrative centers around the long and perilous journey of Odysseus (Ulysse) as he attempts to return home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, facing numerous challenges and adventures along the way, as well as the plight of his wife Penelope and their son Telemachus in his absence.  The opening of \"L'Odyssée\" introduces readers to the aftermath of the Trojan War, setting the stage for Odysseus' tormenting journey home. As the story unfolds, we learn that Odysseus is trapped on the island of Calypso, longing for his homeland while the gods discuss his fate. The narrative shifts to Ithaca, where his son Telemachus is struggling with the pressure of suitors courting his mother, Penelope, in his father's absence. The goddess Athena intervenes, guiding Telemachus to seek news of Odysseus, thus igniting his own quest to confront the challenges that threaten his family and honor.
