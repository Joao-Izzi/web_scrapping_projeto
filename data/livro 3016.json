    "resumo": "“The Welding of the Race (‘449’-1066)” compiled by Rev. John E. W. Wallis is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work is part of a series aimed at providing source materials for English history, particularly focusing on a key period of political and cultural development in Britain. The book collects a range of contemporary and later evidence concerning the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, the arrival of Christianity, and the resulting societal changes, all of which laid the groundwork for modern English identity.  At the start of the volume, the narrative depicts early events leading to the establishment of Anglo-Saxon rule in Britain, particularly the arrival of the Saxons as military allies turned conquerors. The text presents various sources, including descriptions from chroniclers like Bede, which illustrate the changing dynamics of power and culture as the Saxons settled and intertwined with the native Britons. The opening portion frames a dramatic and tumultuous history filled with encounters between different tribes, the conflicts that ensued, and the subsequent shifts in religious practices as Christianity began to take root, setting a rich historical context for understanding the foundations of modern English society.
