The book aims to explore the complex nature of female criminality, shedding light on cases from various periods and examining their societal implications.

The opening of the book sets the stage for an exploration of crime and the perception of women throughout history, beginning with a deep dive into the circumstances surrounding Jean Livingstoneâ€™s arrest for murdering her husband, John Kincaid. The chapter describes the gossip and clamor among the citizens of Edinburgh upon her capture, hinting at the societal fascination with crime, especially when a woman is involved.
