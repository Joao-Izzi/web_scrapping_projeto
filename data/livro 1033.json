    "resumo": "\"Hedda Gabler: Dramo en kvar aktoj\" by Henrik Ibsen is a dramatic work written in the late 19th century. The play centers around the complex character of Hedda Tesman, a woman torn between societal expectations and her own desires, newly married to Jorgen Tesman, who is a struggling academic. The story explores themes of manipulation, freedom, and the constraints of marriage, offering a poignant look at the struggles faced by women of the time.  The opening of the play introduces us to the beautifully decorated salon of Jorgen and Hedda Tesman, where we witness the anticipation surrounding the couple's return from their honeymoon. The scene features Frauxlino Juliane Tesman and Berte, the servant, discussing Hedda and Jorgen's arrival. Their conversation hints at Hedda's strong-willed nature and her discomfort with her new life. As Jorgen enters the scene, he is characterized as a cheerful yet ambitious scholar, eager to share his experiences. This sets the stage for the tensions and conflicts that will arise from Hedda's interactions with her husband and other characters, including the enigmatic Ejlert Lovborg and the influences of societal norms that dictate her actions.
