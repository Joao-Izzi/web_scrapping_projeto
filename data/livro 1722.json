    "resumo": "\"The Star\" by H. G. Wells is a scientific fiction novella written in the early 20th century. This thought-provoking narrative explores the catastrophic effects of a celestial event, specifically the approach of a rogue star that threatens humanity and the Earth. It delves into astronomical concepts and the interplay between cosmic forces and human existence.  The story begins with an astronomer observing the unusual behavior of the planet Neptune, which soon reveals the approach of an ominous new star. Despite the scientist's warnings about the impending disaster, the general public is dismissive of his concerns. As the star draws nearer, it induces a series of catastrophic natural phenomena—earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions—that devastate the planet. The narrative highlights the disconnect between scientific understanding and public perception, illustrating humanity's struggle to respond to existential threats. Ultimately, the story concludes with the star passing by the Earth, leaving behind a transformed landscape and a changed world, though it does not delve into the aftermath in detail.
