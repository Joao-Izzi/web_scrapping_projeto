    "resumo": "\"The Works of William Hogarth: In a Series of Engravings\" by John Trusler is a collection of illustrated moral commentary and art history written in the early 19th century. This work showcases the engravings of the renowned 18th-century artist William Hogarth, accompanied by descriptions and critiques that explore the moral significance inherent in his works. The emphasis is on Hogarth's unique ability to blend humor and social commentary in his art, presenting a vivid picture of 18th-century life.  At the start of this collection, the reader is introduced to William Hogarth’s early life, detailing his modest beginnings, family lineage, and eventual apprenticeship as a silversmith, which honed his engraving skills. The narrative transitions into several anecdotes illustrating Hogarth's burgeoning talents, his marriage, and his initial struggles as an artist. By highlighting the formative experiences and social observations that influenced his artistic development, Trusler sets the stage for an exploration of Hogarth’s major series of engravings, including \"The Harlot’s Progress\" and \"The Rake’s Progress,\" which serve as moral tales warning against vice and folly. Each subsequent section promises to unravel the complexities of Hogarth's visual storytelling, providing insight into the societal themes that continue to resonate today.
