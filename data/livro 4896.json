    "resumo": "\"Noorsche Volksvertellingen\" by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen is a collection of folklore tales gathered and translated for Dutch readers during the late 19th century. The work showcases a variety of Norwegian folk narratives, reflecting the cultural and natural surroundings of Norway while delving into themes of enchantment and mythic beings such as hulder and spirits. The tales are a means of immersing readers in the rich tapestry of Norwegian heritage and beliefs.  The beginning of the collection introduces the reader to the vibrant world of Norwegian folklore through the tale \"De sage in den molen.\" The narrator finds solace in fishing by the river and encounters a mysterious old mill where he meets a talkative miller. As they converse about fishing and the supernatural, the miller’s insights into the mill's spirit world reveal a tapestry of local beliefs about spirits and magic. Soon, a young boy appears, anxious about the eerie environment, prompting the narrator to share a ghostly story about a mill spirit. This intimate exchange leads into tales of the hulder, mysterious entities associated with nature, setting the stage for the subsequent stories which explore themes of magic, nature, and human interactions with the supernatural.
