    "resumo": "\"Nurse Elisia\" by George Manville Fenn is a novel written during the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the Elthorne family, particularly focusing on Neil Elthorne, a young surgeon who is called back from the city to tend to his father following a serious accident. The story delves into themes of family dynamics, the complexities of relationships, and the challenges faced in the medical profession, especially through the lens of Neil's experiences in both his personal life and his medical career.  The opening of \"Nurse Elisia\" presents a vivid portrayal of the Elthorne family during a chaotic breakfast scene, where the irritable patriarch, Mr. Ralph Elthorne, complains about breakfast and is preoccupied with the arrival of his son Neil and his daughters-in-law-to-be, Misses Lydon. The tension escalates when Isabel, Neil's sister, expresses concern for their father's health after he falls off a horse during a ride, prompting the family to confront the gravity of his sudden injuries. This opening sets the stage for familial strife, love interests, and the impact of a tragic accident, hinting at the emotional and social themes that will unfold as the narrative progresses.
