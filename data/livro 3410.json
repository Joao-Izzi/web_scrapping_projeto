    "resumo": "\"Barrington. Volume 2\" by Charles James Lever is a novel written in the early 20th century. This work continues the story of the Barrington family, featuring the main characters Peter Barrington, his sister Miss Dinah, and granddaughter Josephine, as they navigate personal and familial challenges in a picturesque Irish setting. The overarching themes revolve around homecomings, evolving relationships, and the contrast between past affluence and their current modest lifestyle.  The opening of this volume finds Peter Barrington and his family returning to their cottage after a time away, giving way to an exploration of nostalgia and the changes that have taken place during their absence. Josephine, full of youthful enthusiasm, experiences disappointment as she comes to terms with their diminished circumstances. She encounters Polly Dill, a local girl, forming an instant bond that highlights her struggle to adapt to her new life. The narrative delves into the dynamics of familial duty, the return to a simplified existence, and the blossoming friendship between Josephine and Polly. The themes of class and societal expectations are hinted at, especially as the family summons the resilience of their past to embrace their present. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
