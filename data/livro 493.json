    "resumo": "\"Folk-Tales of Napoleon\" by Aleksandr Amfiteatrov and Honoré de Balzac is a collection of folk tales that blend historical fiction with myth, written in the early 20th century. This book combines narratives from Russian and French perspectives to explore the life and legacy of Napoleon Bonaparte, illustrating the impact he had on the collective memory of these two nations. The tales serve as cultural reflections, revealing national character while presenting a fantastical interpretation of Napoleon's persona.  In the first tale, \"Napoleonder,\" a Russian legend describes how God, seeking to punish humanity, creates Napoleon out of sand, imbuing him with the ambition to conquer the world but also warning him against pity. As Napoleonder wreaks havoc across nations, he gradually encounters the consequences of his actions through the humanity of the people he defeats. The second tale, \"The Napoleon of the People,\" told by a former soldier to a group of French peasants, recounts Napoleon's rise and fall, depicting him as a figure favored by God, blessed with victories and hailed as a leader. Both stories emphasize the duality of Napoleon's legacy, portraying him as a ruthless conqueror as well as a heroic figure in the eyes of the people, ultimately reflecting their complex relationships with war, power, and morality.
