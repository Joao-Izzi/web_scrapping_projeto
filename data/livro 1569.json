    "resumo": "\"Poems by Walt Whitman\" by Walt Whitman is a collection of poetry likely written in the mid-19th century. This compilation features a selection of Whitman's works that exemplify his innovative style and thematic preoccupations with identity, democracy, and the human experience in America. The poems explore a range of subjects, often celebrating the individual and the collective spirit of a nation, making it a significant contribution to American literature.  At the start of this volume, the focus is on the author's origins and reflections on the American experience, emphasizing his love for the open landscapes and diverse peoples of the nation. Whitman introduces readers to his journey from Paumanok (Long Island) to the larger American tapestry, suggesting a poetic exploration of universal themes through a distinctly American lens. The text unfolds as a profound manifesto of sorts, where Whitman aims to connect the past with the present while welcoming the readers to participate in a collective exploration of identity and existence, setting the stage for the poignant and audacious verse that characterizes the rest of the collection.
