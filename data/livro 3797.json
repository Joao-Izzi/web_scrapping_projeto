    "resumo": "\"The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem\" by Anonymous is a controversial socio-political treatise written in the early 20th century. This work presents a series of articles originally published in The Dearborn Independent, exploring the so-called \"Jewish Question\" in the context of global financial, political, and social dynamics. The text argues that Jewish people wield disproportionate influence in various sectors and suggests that this presents challenges for the societies in which they reside.  The opening of this publication sets the stage for a critical examination of Jewish identity and its historical ramifications. It introduces the topic by stating that the \"Jewish Question\" has been a longstanding issue in the United States that has recently surfaced more prominently, particularly following World War I. The author argues that Jewish influence extends beyond economics, impacting cultural and political realms as well, and claims that this prominence has led to scrutiny and anti-Semitic sentiments. Throughout the initial chapters, the narrative employs a deeply critical lens on Jewish economic practices, outlining various accusations concerning their control over industries and media while asserting that these traits and behaviors have contributed to an ongoing controversy that affects both Jews and the nations they inhabit.
