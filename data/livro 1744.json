    "resumo": "\"The Waif of the 'Cynthia'\" by Jules Verne and André Laurie is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story explores themes of identity and belonging through the life of Erik Hersebom, a boy raised by a fisherman and his wife after being found abandoned on the sea. Central to the narrative is Erik's journey of self-discovery as he learns about his mysterious origins and the possibilities of his future.  At the start of the book, the reader is introduced to Mr. Malarius, a schoolmaster, and the renowned Dr. Schwaryencrona. The scene unfolds in a primary school in Norway where Dr. Schwaryencrona unexpectedly visits, leading to an impressive evaluation of Erik, who impresses the doctor with his advanced knowledge despite being a fisherman's son. The premise reveals Erik's adoption and hints at a potential hidden lineage, which is further developed as Erik's family discusses the opportunity for him to continue his education under Dr. Schwaryencrona’s guidance. The opening sets the stage for Erik's internal struggle between loyalty to his adopted family and the allure of discovering his true roots. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
