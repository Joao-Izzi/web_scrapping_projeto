    "resumo": "\"The Biglow Papers\" by James Russell Lowell is a satirical collection of poems written in the mid-19th century. The work is presented as a series of letters from the character Hosea Biglow, a farmer, to various figures in the political landscape, capturing the voice of the common American during the period of the Mexican War and the contentious issue of slavery. The dialect used reflects rural New England speech, infusing humor and social criticism throughout the poems.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Ezekiel Biglow, who sends a letter to the editor Joseph T. Buckingham, discussing his son Hoseaâ€™s poetic endeavors. Ezekiel is proud yet comically anxious about his son's foray into poetry, which he describes with a mix of admiration and trepidation. The opening establishes the tone of everyday life in a small village while hinting at deeper political themes, as Hosea's poetry directly addresses issues like war, slavery, and moral responsibility. Through dialect and vivid imagery, the text gives a voice to American sentiments, foreshadowing the critique and wit that characterizes the collection. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
