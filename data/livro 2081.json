    "resumo": "\"Hot Corn: Life Scenes in New York\" by Solon Robinson is a collection of social commentary narratives written in the mid-19th century. The book focuses on the harsh realities faced by the impoverished and downtrodden of New York City, using vivid descriptions of characters like Little Katy, a hot corn seller, to illustrate the struggles of those living in poverty. Through these life scenes, Robinson aims to awaken sympathy and inspire reform, particularly against the social ills exacerbated by alcohol abuse.  At the start of the book, the author reflects on the stark contrast between the wealth of New York City and the abject poverty experienced by many of its residents. He recounts his observations of street children, particularly the young hot corn sellers, whose cries pierce the nightâ€”symbolizing both their despair and their desperate attempts to survive. The initial chapters introduce readers to various characters, telling their harrowing tales while revealing the social injustices perpetuated by wealth and indifference. This setting not only highlights individual stories but also serves as a call to action for reformers and the general public to recognize and address the pervasive issues of poverty, alcohol, and societal neglect.
