    "resumo": "\"The West Riding Territorials in the Great War\" by Laurie Magnus is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book details the experiences and contributions of the West Riding Territorial Force during World War I, focusing on the organization, mobilization, and wartime activities of these citizen-soldiers. The narrative emphasizes the significance of the Territorial Force in the broader context of the war, particularly their dedication and valor on the battlefield.  The opening of the work introduces readers to the formation and mobilization of the West Riding Territorial Division during the lead-up to World War I. It highlights the initial preparations made by the Territorial Force Association, which faced various challenges including public apathy and official indifference before the war. As tensions escalated in Europe, the Association successfully recruited thousands of men, demonstrating a strong spirit of patriotism. The narrative sets the stage for a detailed examination of the troops' journey, beginning with their departure to France in 1915, and illustrates the intertwining of tradition and modern military needs in their formation.
