    "resumo": "\"A Cold Night for Crying\" by Milton Lesser is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story is set in a dystopian future where an alien race called the Karadi has taken control of Earth, enforcing their rule through manipulation and social control. The narrative explores themes of belief, doubt, and the human condition under oppression, centering on the lives of the Friedlander family as they grapple with the loss of their son, Freddie, amidst the harsh realities of their controlled existence.  The story follows Mr. Friedlander and his wife, Martha, as they process the news that their son, Freddie, has been reported dead after his plane was shot down during a conflict with those fighting against the Karadi rule. Struggling between grief and the desire for hope, Martha refuses to believe the official declaration of death, while Mr. Friedlander initially conforms to the oppressive rhetoric, believing their son is indeed dead. However, an old neighbor, Mr. Davidson, reveals that Freddie may still be alive, hinting that he is on the side of the rebels, further complicating the Friedlanders' emotional turmoil. As Mr. Friedlander wrestles with his desire for truth, conformity, and his wife's hope, the story ignites a powerful examination of the impact of authoritarianism on human relationships and the struggle for individual belief in the face of overwhelming doubt.
