    "resumo": "\"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes\" by G. A. Henty is a historical novel set in the late 19th century, focusing on the struggle between Christianity and Islam during the historical events surrounding the Knights of St. John and their defense of Rhodes. The story primarily follows the journey of young Gervaise Tresham, who is being prepared to take on an honorable role within the Order of St. John, as he navigates the political intrigues and social upheavals of the time.  At the start of the tale, the narrative highlights the historical context of the Knights of St. John, detailing their evolution from a religious order ministering to pilgrims to a formidable military force. The opening scene introduces Queen Margaret of Anjou as she anticipates an alliance with the former enemy, the Earl of Warwick, to regain the English throne for her son. Simultaneously, we are introduced to Gervaise, the son of a loyal knight, who is being groomed for a future role within the Order. The early chapters set the stage for the larger political drama unfolding in England while establishing Gervaise's aspirations and the turbulent times that lie ahead as the tension builds toward the imminent siege of Rhodes.
