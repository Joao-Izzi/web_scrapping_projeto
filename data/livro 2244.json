    "resumo": "\"Gunshot Roentgenograms\" by Clyde S. Ford is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book presents a collection of roentgenograms (X-rays) taken during the Turko-Balkan War from 1912-1913, specifically illustrating gunshot wounds inflicted on soldiers of the Turkish army. As such, the publication serves as a significant resource for medical professionals interested in the diagnostic applications of radiography in military medicine.  The opening of the work sets the stage for understanding its purpose and significance by outlining the collection's origins and methodology. Major Ford explains that more than 1,500 plates were reviewed to select the most illustrative examples of gunshot wounds, ultimately presenting 162 radiographs alongside descriptions of each case's clinical context, wound characteristics, and recommended treatments. The early segments also discuss the scientific principles underlying the production of these images and their relevance to understanding the physics of ballistic injuries, thus bridging the gap between medical practice and scientific investigation in wartime settings.
