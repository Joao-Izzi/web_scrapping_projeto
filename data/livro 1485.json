    "resumo": "\"Kritik der reinen Vernunft\" by Immanuel Kant is a philosophical treatise written during the late 18th century, marking a pivotal moment in Western philosophy. The work explores the foundations of metaphysics and epistemology, specifically focusing on the nature and limits of human understanding, a priori knowledge, and the relationship between experience and reason.  The opening of the text provides a detailed introduction to Kantâ€™s philosophical project, positing the need for a critique of pure reason to establish the limits and capabilities of human knowledge. Kant distinguishes between empirical knowledge, derived from experience, and a priori knowledge, which exists independently of experience. He introduces critical concepts such as synthetic and analytical judgments, emphasizing that a true understanding of metaphysical principles requires a rigorous examination of their validity and applicability. By laying out the purpose and framework of his critique, Kant sets the stage for a deep inquiry into how we acquire knowledge and the implications of that knowledge for philosophy and science.
