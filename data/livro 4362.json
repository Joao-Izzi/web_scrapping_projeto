The story revolves around naval officer Bob Hallowell, who is consumed by a cold anger related to a tumultuous past with a woman known as Berta, the titular \"Yellow Typhoon.\" As he seeks to confront her in Manila after years of emotional turmoil, themes of vengeance, love, and betrayal begin to unfold in a richly atmospheric setting.  At the start of the novel, we meet Captain Bob Hallowell, who is grimly determined to confront Berta upon her return to Manila.
