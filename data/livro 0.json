    "resumo": "\"Munka: Elbeszélések\" by Tamás Kóbor is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The book presents a vivid depiction of working-class life and explores social themes, particularly focusing on the lives of laborers and the disparities between the wealthy and the impoverished. The initial chapters introduce the reader to the harsh working conditions faced by two laborers, emphasizing their struggles and frustrations in the face of inequality.  The opening of the collection illustrates a scene at a foundry where two half-naked workers are casting metal and reflecting on their miserable existence compared to the luxurious lives of their wealthy superiors, highlighted by the condescending curiosity of the factory director and others dressed elegantly. The dialogue between the workers reveals their resentment towards the lavish lifestyles of the upper class while they toil for meager pay. The narrative swiftly shifts to portray an evening in the director's office, where he is preoccupied with his work and neglects his wife, who feels ignored and seeks attention elsewhere. This interplay sets a tone for the themes of economic hardship and the complexity of human relationships that are likely to permeate the subsequent stories in the collection.
