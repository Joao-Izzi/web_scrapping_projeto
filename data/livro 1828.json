    "resumo": "\"Through a Microscope\" by Samuel Wells, Mary Treat, and Frederick Leroy Sargent is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work introduces the reader to the world of microscopy, detailing both the scientific principles and practical observations that can be made using a microscope. It covers a range of topics, from the mechanics of vision and the construction of simple microscopes to diverse microscopic organisms observed in natural settings.  The opening of the book begins with a discussion on the limitations of the human eye in perceiving small objects and introduces the concept of the microscope as a tool to overcome these limitations. The authors illustrate initial experiments, showing how to view small objects and the importance of lenses in magnifying them. They subsequently recount an anecdote of three gentlemen exploring nature while engaging boys in the marvels they discover through their pocket microscopes. This sets the stage for an engaging exploration into the fascinating world of microscopic life, inviting readers, especially young enthusiasts, to investigate the unseen wonders that lie just beyond the visible spectrum.
