    "resumo": "\"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves\" is a historical account prepared by the Federal Writers' Project during the late 1930s. This work compiles first-person narratives from former slaves, aiming to document their experiences, hardships, and perspectives on slavery and freedom. The authors' intent is to give a voice to those who lived through this profoundly impactful period in American history, capturing their stories as a means of preserving their legacies.  At the start of the volume, the text introduces several individuals, featuring George W. Arnold, who recalls his life on a Tennessee plantation. His recounting includes poignant memories of his family's early life, childhood fears during the Civil War, and the challenges faced after emancipation. The narrative flows through other interviews highlighting the diverse experiences of former slaves, such as their reflections on bondage, the transition to freedom, and the social ramifications that followed. Each account presents a mixture of nostalgia, trauma, and resilience, illustrating the complex realities of life before and after slavery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
