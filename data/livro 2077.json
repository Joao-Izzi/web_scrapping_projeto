    "resumo": "\"Criminal Psychology: A Manual for Judges, Practitioners, and Students\" by Hans Gross is a scientific publication likely written in the early 20th century. The book serves as a comprehensive guide on the psychological aspects of criminal behavior and the judicial process, focusing on the mental states of judges, witnesses, jurors, and offenders to enhance the understanding of crime and its implications for justice.  The opening of the work establishes the importance of applying psychology to the field of criminal law, arguing that understanding human behavior, perception, and the influences on testimony are crucial for effective legal proceedings. Gross outlines the critical role of judges in discerning truth from witness testimony and delves into the complexities of psychological conditions that can affect evidence gathering and interpretation. He emphasizes the need for judges to be aware of the psychological traits influencing both witnesses and criminals, which serves as a foundation for the discussions that follow throughout the text.
