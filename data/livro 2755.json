    "resumo": "\"A Bankrupt Heart, Vol. 3 (of 3)\" by Florence Marryat is a romance novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds through the complex relationships and emotional turmoil of its characters, primarily focusing on the lives of Nora, Lady Ilfracombe, and Nell Llewellyn. Central to the narrative is the tension and secrecy surrounding past loves, honor, and the societal expectations of the time.  At the start of the volume, the reader is immersed in a dramatic encounter between Nora and Nell after a near-accident involving runaway horses, which raises tensions between their distinctly different social classes. Following the incident, Nora expresses her gratitude toward Nell, who casually downplays her bravery and refuses to accept any form of compensation, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of class differences and personal pride. The chapter also introduces the looming presence of Lord Ilfracombe, through whose past connections with Nell further complicate the dynamics as the narrative progresses. The opening establishes a rich context of emotion, unspoken histories, and the complexities of love and duty that permeate the text. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
