    "resumo": "\"Nem én kiáltok\" by Attila József is a collection of poems written during the early 20th century. This poignant work explores themes of social justice, personal longing, and the struggles of the human condition against the backdrop of a rapidly changing society. József, a significant figure in Hungarian literature, uses his verses to express a deep internal conflict and a yearning for meaning in an often harsh and indifferent world.  The poems within this collection range from personal reflections to broader social commentaries, depicting the experiences of individuals facing societal constraints and existential despair. Through vivid imagery and emotive language, József articulates feelings of love, loss, and the search for identity amidst turmoil. Each poem contributes to a tapestry of voices—those of lovers, the marginalized, and the hopeful—creating a powerful dialogue about the human experience. The collection ends with a call to action, urging readers to recognize their power in shaping their destinies and seeking a brighter future. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
