    "resumo": "\"The Black Fawn\" by Jim Kjelgaard is a novel written in the late 1950s. The story follows a young boy named Bud Sloan, who has recently come to live with an elderly couple, Gramps and Gram Bennett, after leaving the orphanage. As Bud navigates the challenges of a new life on the farm, he grapples with feelings of fear and insecurity while forming bonds with the gentle farm animals, particularly a black fawn that he discovers in the woods.  At the start of the novel, Bud struggles with emotions of fear and vulnerability upon arriving at the Bennett farm. He is introduced to Gramps and Gram, who exhibit kindness despite Budâ€™s hesitancy to accept their affection. As Bud begins to settle into the rhythm of farm life, we see him tackle work and build relationships with both Gramps, who teaches him about farming, and Shep, the farm collie. The opening establishes Bud's inner conflict over his past as an orphan and his longing for belonging, primarily showcased through his attachment to the black fawn, symbolizing his desire for friendship and connection in a world that feels uncertain.
