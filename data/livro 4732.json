    "resumo": "\"The River Boss\" by Stewart Edward White is a short story written in the early 20th century. This narrative delves into the demanding and often perilous world of river log driving, emphasizing the challenges faced by those responsible for moving logs downstream to meet contractual obligations. The story's focus is centered on Jimmy, a river boss who embodies resilience and ingenuity in the face of adversity.  In the tale, Jimmy is tasked with the urgent job of driving 5,000,000 feet of logs downriver within a strict deadline. Despite his small stature and calm demeanor, he possesses remarkable skills and determination. As he orchestrates his crew through the various challenges of log jams, icy waters, and demanding deadlines, Jimmy's clever strategies, including raising the water level of a dam unlawfully, showcase his resourcefulness. When obstacles arise and the threat of missing the deadline looms, Jimmy takes matters into his own hands, leading to a dramatic—and illegal—resolution. Ultimately, Jimmy's actions draw the ire of authorities, leading to his arrest, but he remains undeterred, focused on fulfilling his duty to deliver the logs on time, highlighting the blend of audacity and necessity that defines his character.
