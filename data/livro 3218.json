    "resumo": "\"The Wanderers\" by Mary Johnston is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story opens with a vivid depiction of an ancient forest inhabited by primitive beings known as the tree-folk, exploring their daily lives, struggles, and the beginnings of self-awareness. The main character, a tree-folk woman with a young one, demonstrates a growing consciousness and curiosity about her surroundings, setting the stage for significant themes of survival and the evolution of human understanding.  The opening of the novel intricately portrays the life of a tree-folk woman who navigates the complexities of her forested world, filled with trees, wildlife, and fellow tree-folk. As she encounters various challenges, such as finding food and evading dangers like thunderstorms and predatory animals, her experiences spark a shift in her awareness. The narrative captures her dual feelings of isolation and critical observation of her society while introducing her instinctual protectiveness towards her young one. This blend of elements hints at broader themes of discovery, evolution, and the quest for belonging that are likely to unfold throughout the rest of the narrative.
