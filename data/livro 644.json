    "resumo": "\"Martian Terror\" by Ed Earl Repp is a science fiction novelette written in the early 20th century, specifically during the period of the 1940s. The story unfolds on Venus, depicting a tense and oppressive context of Martian rule over the planet's native inhabitants. The likely topic of the book centers around revolution, exploration of identity, and the struggle for freedom against a backdrop of imperialism.  The narrative follows Lolan, a young Martian officer, who grapples with the moral implications of his role in oppressing the gentle Venusians. As he witnesses the suffering of the native population and develops feelings for Princess Mora, he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the brutal Martian regime. Following a series of events that see him entangled in revolutionary plots, Lolan discovers his own hidden heritage as a lost Venusian prince and teams up with Mora and her father, Atarkus. Together, they orchestrate a rebellion against their oppressors, employing clever strategies to reclaim their freedom. Themes of loyalty, identity, and the quest for justice drive the plot forward to an exhilarating conclusion, where Lolan must navigate his complex feelings and the harsh realities of war.
