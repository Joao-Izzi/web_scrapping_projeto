    "resumo": "\"L'amour fessé\" by Charles Derennes is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative seems to revolve around complex themes of love, family dynamics, and the past, focusing on the life of Calixte-Léonce Vidal, who is presented as the main character. The story intricately weaves the protagonist's familial relationships, particularly with his sister Jacqueline, against a backdrop of nostalgia and reflections on the nature of happiness in love.  The opening of the novel introduces Calixte, who finds himself in a melancholic mood amidst memories that intertwine with his present. He is visited by his younger sister Jacqueline in their family home, where a warm yet bittersweet camaraderie is evident. The setting evokes a deep sense of longing for the past, particularly in Calixte’s wish to forget sad memories while simultaneously grappling with them. Through evocative descriptions and dialogues, the initial chapters establish a contrast between the vibrant life Jacqueline leads and Calixte's introspection, setting the stage for an exploration of familial love, regret, and the bittersweet nature of existence.
