    "resumo": "\"The Chronicles of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, Vol. 02\" by Enguerrand de Monstrelet is a historical account written in the early 15th century. This volume continues the narrative of the civil wars between the Houses of Orleans and Burgundy, as well as detailing significant events during the period of English control in France. The book focuses on the political intrigues, battles, and ramifications of these historical events, particularly the conflict surrounding the assassination of the Duke of Orleans and the ensuing demands for justice by his widow and children.  The opening of this volume presents a detailed legal appeal made by the advocate of the Duchess of Orleans, urging the council to seek justice for the murder of her husband. It outlines her plea for equity and compassion from the king and other noble lords, likening her suffering to that of a biblical widow. The text also introduces the response from the king's council and sets the stage for the intense political maneuvering that follows, encapsulating the tensions and power struggles present in this tumultuous period in French history.
