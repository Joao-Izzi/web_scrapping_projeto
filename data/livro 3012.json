    "resumo": "\"A True Relation of the Apparition of one Mrs. Veal\" by Daniel Defoe is a supernatural pamphlet published in the early 18th century. This work is centered around the eerie encounter between two women, Mrs. Bargrave and the ghost of her deceased friend, Mrs. Veal. Defoe’s narrative explores themes of death, friendship, and the afterlife, suggesting a reflection on morality and the fear of mortality.  The story begins with Mrs. Bargrave, who lives in Canterbury, as she receives an unexpected visit from Mrs. Veal, whom she has not seen in over two years. During their lengthy conversation, which touches on various subjects including Drelincourt's work on death, Mrs. Veal shares comforting words and requests that Mrs. Bargrave convey messages to her brother regarding her belongings. However, this visit takes a chilling turn when it is revealed that Mrs. Veal died the day before their meeting. The narrative unfolds as Mrs. Bargrave relates her encounter, revealing that only she and Mrs. Veal had knowledge of the specific details discussed, including the description of Mrs. Veal's gown. The pamphlet leaves readers to ponder the authenticity of the apparition, while also serving as an intriguing commentary on societal beliefs surrounding the supernatural during Defoe’s time.
