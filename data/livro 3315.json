    "resumo": "\"History of Friedrich II of Prussia — Volume 14\" by Thomas Carlyle is a historical account written in the mid-19th century. The book explores the complex political and military landscape of Europe during the reign of Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great, focusing particularly on the period of the Austrian Succession War from August 1742 to July 1744. It discusses Frederick's ambition for peace following his acquisition of Silesia, and lays the groundwork for understanding his role in the broader conflicts involving Austria, Britain, and France.  The opening of this volume introduces Frederick II's desire for stability after having secured Silesia, expressing hopes that this regional resolution might lead to a broader European peace. However, Carlyle foreshadows the ongoing warfare as tensions persist, with Austria and Britain demonstrating renewed aggressiveness. The narrative depicts Frederick's character as a pragmatic ruler trying to navigate the turbulent political waters while engaging in cultural pursuits, such as opening an opera house and advocating for legal reforms. The intricacies of alliances and enmities are set against a backdrop of personal and national interests, hinting at the intricate dance Frederick must perform to maintain his kingdom's integrity amidst the chaos of the wider European conflict.
