    "resumo": "\"The Fishdollar Affair\" by Richard McKenna is a science fiction novel written in the late 1950s. The story revolves around Ensign Stephen Welnicki, who finds himself at the helm of an unexpected political and military crisis involving a group of settlers from a new planet, Fishdollar Five. As Welnicki navigates through this interstellar tension, the narrative blends elements of adventure and humor within an ironic and tender examination of duty, loyalty, and personal honor.  In the book, Ensign Welnicki is faced with a mutiny aboard the S.S. Rubberjack, which leads to the emergence of the self-proclaimed President Wendrew Fishdollar. With the authority of the Galactic Patrol behind him, Welnicki is tasked with regaining control of the ship and its crew, while also dealing with the unexpected dynamics of a female-dominated society on Fishdollar Five. As tensions escalate, Welnicki must balance his duties as a Galactic Patrol officer with his growing affection for the planet's inhabitants, leading to an unexpected twist that culminates in a deeply personal and politically charged conclusion. The story ultimately explores themes of love, identity, and the complexities of power in a whimsical yet thought-provoking manner. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
