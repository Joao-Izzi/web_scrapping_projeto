    "resumo": "\"The Butterflies and Moths of Teneriffe\" by A. E. Holt White is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work serves as a detailed account and guide to the Lepidoptera of Teneriffe, providing descriptions and illustrations of various butterflies and moths found on the island, as well as insights into their life cycles and collecting methods. It aims to fill a significant gap in literature regarding the entomology of the Canary Islands for both enthusiasts and collectors alike.  The opening of this work presents a preface where the author explains her motivation for writing about the butterflies and moths of Teneriffe after relocating there for the winter. She notes the scarcity of literature addressing the local Lepidoptera and advocates for the enjoyment and health benefits of studying these insects. The introductory chapter delineates the classifications and life stages of butterflies and moths while promising practical advice for novices, such as techniques for collection, breeding, and care of specimens. Throughout these early sections, the author emphasizes the beauty and diversity of the island's butterflies and encourages readers to explore the natural landscapes of Teneriffe to enhance their understanding and appreciation of these creatures.
