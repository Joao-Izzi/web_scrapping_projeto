    "resumo": "\"The Last Miracle\" by M. P. Shiel is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book delves into themes of mysticism, the supernatural, and the intersection of science and spirituality. The narrative appears to revolve around the experiences of Dr. A. Lister Browne, who corresponds with a friend about his unique encounters with a woman named Miss Mary Wilson, who possesses extraordinary trance and psychic abilities.  The opening of the novel introduces the reader to a letter from Dr. Browne detailing his encounters with Miss Wilson, who, while in a trance, seems to have the ability to access knowledge from both the past and future. As Browne reflects on his experiences, he indicates that their connection and her seemingly otherworldly powers may hold deeper significance related to broader philosophical and spiritual questions. Additionally, there are hints of a larger plot involving other characters, most notably the relationships within the Langler family and the mysterious events surrounding the disappearance of a servant named Robinson, indicating that the narrative may intertwine personal stories with broader societal themes.
