    "resumo": "\"Men I'm Not Married To; Women I'm Not Married To\" by Dorothy Parker and Franklin P. Adams is a witty collection of character sketches and humorous poems written in the early 20th century, specifically in the 1920s. The book presents a satirical examination of various men and women in the authors' lives, highlighting the quirks, follies, and idiosyncrasies of these individuals who are notable yet never achieved romantic entanglement with the authors. The likely topic revolves around the social observations and comedic insights into the dynamics of friendship and unrequited love.  The first part, authored by Parker, introduces a series of amusingly exaggerated male characters such as Freddie, Mortimer, and Charlie, each embodying specific traits that elicit both laughter and exasperation. Freddie is the quintessential life of the party, relentlessly humorous but often taken for granted, while others like Mortimer and Charlie showcase their own peculiarities that make them memorable yet unlovable. In the second part, penned by Adams, the focus shifts to women with names like Elaine and Maude, revealing their personalities and how they intersect with the author's life, ranging from charming to overbearingly pedantic. Throughout these sketches, the authors cleverly convey the idea that love and attachment often come with complexities that can evoke both amusement and relief that they remain unmarried to these unique individuals.
