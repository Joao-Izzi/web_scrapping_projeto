    "resumo": "\"Checklist\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley and Gene Damon is a bibliographic resource published in the late 20th century. It serves as a comprehensive reference for lesbian and homosexual fiction in English and offers insights into various related materials for collectors, students, and librarians. The work aims to list, document, and review novels dealing with lesbianism and male homosexuality, including poetry and films relevant to the topic.  At the start of \"Checklist,\" the editors outline the book's purpose and highlight the intent to compile an extensive catalog of lesbian fiction, clarifying what qualifies as \"lesbian\" or \"variant\" content in various works. They emphasize the significance of including not only significant novels but also works with minimal or dubious homosexual themes, establishing a critical framework for assessing literary merit. Various listings and symbols are introduced to denote the quality and type of each entry, providing a thorough and accessible guide for readers interested in exploring representations of lesbian relationships within literature.
