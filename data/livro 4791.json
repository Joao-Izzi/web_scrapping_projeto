    "resumo": "\"The Glebe 1914/03 (Vol. 1, No. 6): Erna Vitek\" by Alfred Kreymborg is a fictional work written in the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around themes of morality and relationships as it explores the life of the protagonist, Erna Vitek, as seen through the perspectives of three male friendsâ€”a painter, a writer, and a composer. Their discussions and dilemmas regarding her character add depth to her role and the unfolding drama of her interactions with them.  At the start of the story, we are introduced to Erna through a conversation among Bainbridge Breen, Eric Nielsen, and John Carstairs, who debate the moral implications of her character as a waitress. Their lighthearted banter takes a serious turn as Breen proposes that they \"test\" Erna, leading each of them to develop a rapport with her in different ways. The scene shifts to Erna herself, who grapples with her feelings towards a former lover, Jimmy Allen, as well as her encounters with the three men. Kreymborg deftly weaves humor with poignant observations on human relationships and societal expectations, setting the stage for the complexities of Erna's life that are to unfold in the subsequent chapters.
