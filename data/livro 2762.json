    "resumo": "\"The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded\" by Delia Salter Bacon is a philosophical examination of the works attributed to William Shakespeare, written during the mid-19th century. The text aims to uncover a hidden philosophical system underlying Shakespeare's plays, suggesting that they reflect a deeper intellectual tradition shared with contemporaries like Lord Bacon.   The opening of this work introduces the author's pursuit of demonstrating that Shakespeare's plays, often viewed solely through a literary lens, harbor a profound and systematic philosophy. Delia Bacon argues that this philosophy, which encompasses moral, political, and ethical dimensions, is intricately woven into the fabric of the plays. The preface, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, emphasizes the author's dedication to revealing the complexities and secret narratives behind the writings of Shakespeare and others from that era. Bacon expresses that the Elizabethan context, dominated by political tension and a need for subtlety in expression, shaped the way these philosophical ideas were communicated, and this inquiry is set to unravel those hidden meanings and interconnections.
