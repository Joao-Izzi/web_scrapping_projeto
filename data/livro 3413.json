    "resumo": "\"De 'handel in blanke slavinnen'\" by Wolter Louis Albert Collard is a scholarly treatise written in the late 19th century. This work serves as a PhD dissertation examining the white slave trade, specifically focusing on the mechanisms and implications of trafficking women and girls into prostitution across various regions and countries. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the legal and societal challenges involved in combating this form of human exploitation.  The opening of this dissertation introduces the grave issue of the white slave trade, discussing how deceptive practices are used to lure women into a life of prostitution, often far removed from their home environments. Collard cites specific cases and methods employed by traffickers, illustrating the complexity and international nature of this trade. He emphasizes the varying degrees of exploitation, from local trafficking to more severe cases involving international transportation of victims, thereby establishing a framework for further analysis in the subsequent chapters. These details create a somber context for understanding the systemic abuses that accompany the trade in human lives. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
