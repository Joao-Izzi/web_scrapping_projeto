    "resumo": "\"Dating Pilipinas\" by Sofronio G. Calderón is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work focuses on the early history and cultural practices of the various indigenous peoples of the Philippines, aiming to illuminate aspects of Philippine society that have been largely forgotten over time. Calderón appears to explore the early inhabitants of the islands, tracing their origins and customs.  At the start of the book, the author expresses a desire to help others understand the rich history of the Philippines, particularly its indigenous populations, such as the \"Itim\" or \"Ita\" people. He explains that these groups occupy various regions across the archipelago and provides details about their way of life, including their clothing, dietary habits, and social structures. The opening also suggests that the author draws on historical sources and research to compile this information, indicating a scholarly approach to documenting the country's past.
