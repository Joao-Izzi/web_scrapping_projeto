    "resumo": "\"L'Odyssée\" by Homer is an epic poem believed to have been composed in the late 8th or early 7th century BC. This foundational work of Western literature chronicles the adventures of Odysseus, particularly focusing on his arduous journey home to Ithaca following the Trojan War. Central to the narrative is Odysseus himself, whose cleverness and resilience are repeatedly tested as he faces numerous challenges, including temptations, mythical creatures, and the fury of the sea god Poseidon.  The opening portion of \"L'Odyssée\" calls upon the Muse to recount the trials of Odysseus, capturing his ten-year struggle to return home after the fall of Troy. As the story begins, we learn that while many of his comrades have returned home, Odysseus remains trapped on an island, yearning for his wife Penelope and his homeland. The gods deliberate over his fate, with Athène advocating for him and Poseidon holding a grudge because Odysseus blinded his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. Meanwhile, back in Ithaca, we are introduced to Telemachus, Odysseus’s son, who is distressed by the presence of suitors vying for his mother's hand while consuming his family's wealth. This section sets the stage for the unfolding adventures and struggles that both father and son must endure. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
