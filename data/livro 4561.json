    "resumo": "\"La strega, ovvero, degli inganni de' demoni: dialogo\" by Giovan Francesco Pico della Mirandola is a philosophical dialogue written in the late 19th century. The text examines themes of witchcraft and the deceptions propagated by demons, likely addressing the broader societal issues surrounding superstition during its time. The dialogue features key characters including two friends, Apistio and Fronimo, as well as a witch and an inquisitor, who engage in discussions about the nature of witchcraft and its connection to demonic influence.   At the start of the dialogue, Apistio and Fronimo encounter a large crowd in the square, stirred by rumor of a witch being captured. Curious, they decide to investigate, with Apistio expressing a desire to see a witch, indicating both skepticism and fascination with the concept. The conversation touches on various cultural beliefs about witches throughout history, including attitudes from ancient writers, leading to questions about demonic transformations and the allure of such supernatural narratives. This opening portion sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the interplay between societal fears of witchcraft and the philosophical reflections on truth and deception.
