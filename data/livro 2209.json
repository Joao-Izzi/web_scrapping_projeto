    "resumo": "\"Iphigenie auf Tauris\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a dramatic play written during the late 18th century. The narrative revolves around the central character Iphigenia, who finds herself caught in a web of fate, loyalty, and divine intervention as she navigates her life on the shores of Tauris, far from her beloved Greece.  The opening of \"Iphigenie auf Tauris\" introduces Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, reflecting on her isolation and the burden of her priestly duties in the temple of Artemis. She expresses deep sorrow over her separation from family and the hardships faced by women in a patriarchal society. As the scene unfolds, Iphigenia receives a message from Thoas, King of Tauris, who wishes to make her his bride, complicating her desire for freedom and return to her homeland. The appearance of Arkas, the King's envoy, further intensifies her internal conflict as he encourages her to accept the King's advances while also hinting at the darker implications of her role as a priestess. These exchanges lay the groundwork for Iphigenia's struggles between duty, personal desire, and the looming presence of fate. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
