    "resumo": "\"The Old Maid (The 'Fifties)\" by Edith Wharton is a novel written during the early 20th century. Set in the affluent New York society of the 1850s, it explores themes of social status, love, and the constraints placed upon women. The narrative introduces key figures, particularly Delia Ralston and her cousin Charlotte Lovell, navigating the expectations and limitations of their time, with a focus on familial relationships and the pressures to conform to societal norms.  The opening of the story presents a vivid depiction of New York's upper class, particularly the Ralston family, which embodies both wealth and a strong adherence to tradition. Delia, a young matron, reflects on her marriage, her social standing, and her role within the family. Meanwhile, her cousin Charlotte is grappling with the potential for spinsterhood, made more urgent by her troubled past and a secret that complicates her relationship with societal expectations. As the two cousins interact, the narrative hints at deeper conflicts and emotional struggles, particularly surrounding love, duty, and the sacrifices women make in pursuit of both.
