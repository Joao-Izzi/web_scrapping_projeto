    "resumo": "\"The Clever Woman of the Family\" by Charlotte M. Yonge is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Rachel Curtis, a young woman who feels increasingly frustrated with the constraints of conventional society and seeks to find a meaningful mission in her life. As the narrative unfolds, Rachel grapples with her aspirations for social change while balancing her familial duties and the expectations of her mother and sister.  At the start of the novel, we meet Rachel and her sister Grace as they navigate the complexities of their lives following the loss of their father. Rachel expresses her dissatisfaction with the superficial charity often expected of women of her station, yearning instead for a more impactful role in the community. The arrival of their cousin Fanny, a widow with multiple young boys, marks a significant turning point for Rachel, who feels compelled to take charge of the childrenâ€™s education and well-being. As she begins to engage with Fanny's family, Rachel's resolute determination to find her mission not only highlights her character but also sets the stage for her struggle against societal norms and her development throughout the novel.
