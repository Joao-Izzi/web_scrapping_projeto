    "resumo": "\"Plotinos: Complete Works, v. 2\" by Plotinus is a philosophical treatise written in the early 3rd century. This volume contains the continued compilation of Plotinus's works, focusing on concepts central to Neoplatonism, such as the One, the nature of existence, and the relationship between the soul and the universe. The text is profound in its exploration of metaphysical questions, particularly regarding the essence of the soul and its omnipresence within the cosmos.  The beginning of this work introduces critical philosophical inquiries into the nature of the universe and the soul. It contemplates whether the world-soul is entirely present in the world-body and discusses the idea that the soul fills all space while remaining indivisible. Additionally, the text challenges the reader to consider how existence and essence differ across beings, presenting several metaphysical propositions regarding unity, potentiality, and actuality. Through these dense philosophical explorations, Plotinus lays the groundwork for understanding the interconnectedness of all existence and the divine principles that underlie the material world.
