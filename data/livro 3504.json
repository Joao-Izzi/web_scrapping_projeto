    "resumo": "\"Anthony the Absolute\" by Samuel Merwin is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Anthony Ives Eckhart, a scientific man deeply interested in music and ethnomusicology, as he embarks on a voyage to the East, navigating the complex interactions with the various characters onboard, especially the boastful Sir Robert and a rugged fellow traveler, Archibald Crocker. As Eckhart attempts to assert the value of musical intervals—drawing distinctions between Eastern and Western music—his journey evolves into a profound exploration of culture, personal relationships, and human emotions against the backdrop of early 20th century transoceanic travel.  At the start of the novel, we find Eckhart uncomfortable aboard a ship headed to Yokohama, troubled by Sir Robert's pretentious monologues and the chaos surrounding him. He wrestles with his own thoughts and dismisses the boisterous conversations around him, instead reflecting on the varied passengers' motives for their travels across the globe. Eckhart's ire ignites when Sir Robert belittles the music of Eastern cultures, propelling him into a passionate argument defending the native sounds. This confrontation hints at Eckhart's deeper commitments to his scientific pursuits, setting the stage for an encounter with the complexities of human desire and connection, particularly in the emerging context of East-West interactions. The opening illustrates not only Eckhart's intellectual rigor but also foreshadows the emotional trials he will face in his pursuit to understand the intrinsic nature of music and culture.
