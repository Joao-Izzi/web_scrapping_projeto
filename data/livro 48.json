    "resumo": "\"The Remains of Hesiod the Ascræan, Including the Shield of Hercules\" by Hesiod is a collection of ancient Greek poetry and scholarly commentary, written in the early 19th century. This work includes translations of Hesiod's notable poems along with a dissertation detailing his life, era, and the mythology contained within his works. It appears to delve into agricultural wisdom, the intricacies of ancient Greek myths, and the philosophical reflections on society and justice that resonate through Hesiod's writings.  At the start of this volume, Hesiod's legacy is established, alongside discussions on previous translations and interpretations of his works. The translator, Charles Abraham Elton, critiques earlier attempts at bringing Hesiod's writings into English while asserting the significance of these remains as reflections of ancient Greek culture. The opening also provides insight into the poet's character and life, exploring the traditions surrounding his authorship and the cultural context of his time—particularly his emphasis on moral teachings through allegories and the portrayal of mythological tales that shaped the ancient Greek worldview.
