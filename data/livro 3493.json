    "resumo": "“The Disowned — Volume 01” by Edward Bulwer Lytton is a novel written during the early 19th century. The book introduces readers to a young, adventurous protagonist whose journey leads him to encounter a vibrant gypsy community, emphasizing themes of freedom, identity, and the contrast between societal expectations and the allure of wanderlust. As the story unfolds, the main character, Clarence Linden, grapples with his heritage, societal disconnection, and aspirations for success that shape his narrative.  The opening of the novel sets a picturesque scene of a warm evening in the English countryside, where the youthful Clarence meets a tall stranger—identified as a gypsy—on his way to the town of W----. Their conversation reveals Clarence’s spirited nature as he sings a joyful tune and shares an eagerness to escape the confines of society. The gypsy invites him to join his tribe for the night, leading to a lively feast filled with camaraderie and laughter. As the young traveler settles into the gypsy lifestyle, he discovers the warmth and freedom that the life of a wanderer can offer, contrasting sharply with his own feelings of abandonment and the pressures of his past. This introduction establishes both Clarence’s charming character and the deep-seated desire for adventure and belonging that will drive the unfolding story.
