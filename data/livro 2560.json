    "resumo": "\"The Australian Army Medical Corps in Egypt\" by Sir James W. Barrett and P. E. Deane is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book provides an illustrated and detailed narrative of the early organization and operations of the Australian Medical units in Egypt during the First World War, particularly in the years 1914-1915. It focuses on the medical service's response to the outbreak of war and the consequent challenges faced in delivering healthcare to soldiers.  The beginning of the text outlines the initial state of the Australian Army Medical Corps at the outbreak of World War I, describing its structure of medical officers primarily engaged in civil practice prior to the war. As the war intensified, there was a tremendous call for medical support, which led to the rapid mobilization and expansion of the medical services in Egypt. The narrative emphasizes the challenges and improvisations the Medical Corps faced, notably the logistical difficulties in transporting medical personnel and equipment to the frontlines and the need for efficient hospital management amid emerging medical crises. The account sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the experiences and strategies employed by the Australian Medical Corps in a tumultuous wartime environment.
