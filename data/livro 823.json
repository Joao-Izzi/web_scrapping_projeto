    "resumo": "\"The Man Who Was Pale\" by Jack Sharkey is a short story written in the late 1950s, originally published in Fantastic Science Fiction Stories. This tale blends elements of horror and dark humor, focusing on the peculiar interactions between a kind-hearted yet overly concerned landlady and her mysterious tenant, Vandor Thobal. The story explores themes of fear, curiosity, and the unknown, as well as the lengths to which one might go to ensure their own comfortâ€”or survival.  In the story, Mrs. Tibbets, a worry-prone landlady, rents out rooms in her large house to tenants in need of shelter, one of whom is the unnervingly pale Vandor Thobal. Thobal's odd habits and nocturnal lifestyle lead to Mrs. Tibbets's escalating concern, particularly as she notices strange occurrences around him and hears rumors of mysterious health crises in the neighborhood. Despite her apprehensions, she tries to help him, eventually discovering that Thobal harbors a darker secret linked to his unearthly appearance and his attachment to a peculiar wooden box. The climax reveals that Thobal is not as he seems, leading to a startling and unsettling conclusion. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
