    "resumo": "\"The Silverado Squatters\" by Robert Louis Stevenson is a travel narrative written in the late 19th century. The book chronicles Stevenson's journey to Silverado, California, where he and his wife explore the natural beauty of Mount Saint Helena and the surrounding areas, reflecting on their experiences as they engage with the local environment and people, particularly focusing on their aim to establish a squatter's life in this rustic setting.  At the start of the narrative, the author vividly describes the tranquil and picturesque landscape around Mount Saint Helena, emphasizing its impressive height and the rich natural life that thrives in its vicinity. Stevenson introduces readers to Calistoga, a town that embodies the essence of frontier life, with its mixture of faded charm and rustic simplicity. As the couple makes their way to Silverado, they encounter various characters and experiences that highlight the contrasts of civilization and wilderness, along with a sense of nostalgia for a simpler, less structured way of life. Overall, the opening portion sets the tone for an exploration of both the physical and philosophical landscapes they traverse. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
