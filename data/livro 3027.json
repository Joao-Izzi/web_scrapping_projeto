    "resumo": "\"The Feather\" by Ford Madox Ford is a fantasy novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set in a mythical kingdom and follows the adventures of a young princess, Ernalie, who is kidnapped by an eagle and taken on a journey that leads her to encounter strange characters and extraordinary circumstances. Themes of adventure, self-discovery, and the contrast between royalty and common life weave through her experiences.  The opening of the story introduces readers to a beautifully secluded kingdom ruled by a well-meaning but ineffectual king and his self-willed daughter, Princess Ernalie. After a playful scene where the princess pelts swans with rose leaves, her curiosity about what lies beyond the mountains leads to her abduction by an eagle. Ultimately, the king descends into despair over his daughter's disappearance, prompting him to seek guidance from a wise woman. The narrative quickly pivots to focus on Ernalie's initial bewilderment and escalating challenges as she attempts to navigate her new and dangerous surroundings, setting up her characterâ€™s extensive journey ahead.
