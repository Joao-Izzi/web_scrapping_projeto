    "resumo": "\"Ancient Art of the Province of Chiriqui, Colombia\" by William H. Holmes is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work explores the archaeological and artistic heritage of the Chiriqui province, focusing on ancient artifacts and burial practices. Holmes dives into aspects of the region's geography, culture, and craftsmanship, providing insights into the lives and artistic expressions of its ancient inhabitants.  At the start of the book, the author introduces Chiriqui's geography and its historical significance, noting its previous obscurity until the railroad and canal explorations shed light on the area. Holmes discusses the limited antiquarian literature available, which primarily consists of brief sketches by explorers and archaeologists. He also emphasizes the archaeological findings from ancient cemeteries (huacales) scattered throughout the region, detailing various burial practices and grave constructions observed by explorers, especially the diverse and sophisticated artifacts discovered within these graves, which indicate a rich cultural heritage that has largely remained unnoticed.
