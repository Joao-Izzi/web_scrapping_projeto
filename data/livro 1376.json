    "resumo": "\"Il dolore nell'arte: discorso\" by Antonio Fogazzaro is a philosophical discourse written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the exploration of pain and its representation in art, examining how suffering can evoke profound beauty and emotional resonance. Fogazzaro articulates the idea that art’s most compelling expressions often stem from the depths of human pain, suggesting that there exists a hidden beauty beneath this anguish.  In the discourse, Fogazzaro reflects on the complexities of pain as portrayed by various artists, poets, and philosophers throughout history. He discusses different forms of suffering ranging from personal grief to existential despair, and how these experiences have been immortalized through artistic creations. He evokes powerful imagery and examples, such as Michelangelo's sculptures and Dante’s literary masterpieces, to illustrate how pain can lead to a deeper understanding of beauty. Ultimately, Fogazzaro suggests that while pain may initially seem repulsive, it can bring forth a transformative beauty that enriches both the artist and the observer, creating a profound connection that transcends mere representation.
