    "resumo": "\"Myths and Legends of Our Own Land — Volume 04: Tales of Puritan Land\" by Charles M. Skinner is a collection of folklore and historical narratives likely written in the late 19th century. This volume delves into the rich tapestry of legends from the Puritan settlements in New England, exploring the trials, tribulations, and tales of its inhabitants, including themes of love, loss, and the supernatural.  The opening portion introduces various tales steeped in Puritan beliefs and experiences. It begins with the poignant story of Evangeline Bellefontaine, who is separated from her beloved Gabriel Lajeunesse during the British expulsion of the Acadians, leading her on a long and heart-wrenching search for him. Other stories follow, introducing a mix of humor and tragedy, highlighting characters such as the lazy Swunksus and the reclusive Lewiston Hermit, each intertwined with local lore and settings that reflect the era's struggles and cultural fabric. As the narratives unfold, readers are invited to experience the unique blend of history and myth that characterizes early American life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
