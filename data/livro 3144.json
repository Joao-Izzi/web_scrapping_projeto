    "resumo": "\"The Vision Splendid\" by D. K. Broster and G. Winifred Taylor is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set against the backdrop of early 19th century England, the story revolves around the life of Horatia Grenville, a well-educated yet unmarried woman navigating societal expectations and personal aspirations. The narrative unfolds in her picturesque garden, where she grapples with her desire for intellectual fulfillment while contending with the pressures of marriage and domesticity.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Horatia as she enjoys her summer afternoon, ostensibly reading Plato, yet lost in her thoughts about the roles women play in society. We learn about her unconventional upbringing as a parson's daughter and her aversion to societal norms that expect women to prioritize marriage over personal ambition. Encounters with Tristram Hungerford, a family friend who has proposed to her in the past, set the tone for a deepening relationship fraught with unspoken feelings. The narrative hints at emerging tensions as societal currents of the period shift, blending themes of individual desire with the expectations of family and society.
