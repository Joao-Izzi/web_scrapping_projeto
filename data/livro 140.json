    "resumo": "\"Domesday Book\" by Edgar Lee Masters is a narrative poetry collection that appears to have been written in the early 20th century. The work seems to center around the life, death, and legacy of Elenor Murray, exploring the interconnectedness of human lives, particularly how one individual's fate can ripple through the lives of others, revealing an intricate tapestry of relationships and consequences.  The opening of the narrative introduces Elenor Murray, whose tragic death sets off a chain of reflections about her life and the lives she touched. It begins by discussing the profound impact every life has on others, suggesting that the circles of influence are far-reaching and complex. As the story progresses, we learn about Elenor's early life, her aspirations, and the significant moments leading to her demise. The exploration is layered with the perspectives of various characters, like Coroner Merival and Elenorâ€™s father, who provide insight into her character, family dynamics, and the societal pressures that shaped her life. The narrative foretells that the inquiry into her death will not only reveal the circumstances surrounding it but also offer a poignant commentary on broader human experiences and struggles.
