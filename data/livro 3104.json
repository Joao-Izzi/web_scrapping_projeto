    "resumo": "\"Lord Lister No. 0115: Een Sinterklaas-verrassing\" by Anonymous et al. is a fictional narrative likely written in the late 19th century. The story weaves together elements of mystery, familial relationships, and the celebration of Sinterklaas, a traditional Dutch holiday. Central to the plot is the character of Mr. Deelman, a Spanish consul living in Rotterdam, and his wife, who unexpectedly receive a mysterious parcel containing a living child, setting off a series of curious events.  At the start of the narrative, the scene is established on the evening of December 5th, marking the Sinterklaas festivities despite the dreary weather. In their stately home, the Deelmans reflect on the changes in their family dynamics and traditions since their daughters have moved abroad. The narrative takes a turn when they receive an unexpected delivery: a beautifully wrapped basket containing a baby. The couple's shock and confusion lead to a detailed examination of the infant, revealing hints of nobility through its clothing and a large check hidden among its garments. This startling surprise suggests a deeper mystery involving a noble lineage and possible connections to larger narratives, creating intrigue right from the beginning.
