    "resumo": "\"Fundamental Philosophy, Vol. 2 (of 2)\" by Jaime Luciano Balmes is a philosophical treatise written in the mid-19th century. This volume continues exploring the nature of knowledge, focusing on ideas, intellectual acts, and the foundational principles of philosophy. Balmes critiques various philosophical systems, particularly the ideas of Condillac and Kant, addressing the relationships between sensation, intuition, and reasoning.  At the start of the text, the author makes a critical examination of the transition from sensations to ideas, emphasizing that while sensations are essential to our understanding, they cannot fully account for the complexity of our cognitive processes. He discusses the implications of different philosophical perspectives on ideas, reflecting particularly on Condillac's notion that all intellectual activity is derived from sensations. Balmes argues for the necessity of recognizing a distinct intellectual activity that transcends mere sensory experiences. He thus lays the groundwork for a deeper inquiry into the nature of understanding and knowledge, challenging simplifications found in previous philosophical discourses.
