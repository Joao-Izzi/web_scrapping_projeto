    "resumo": "\"The Trespasser\" by Gilbert Parker is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story follows Gaston Belward, a man of mixed heritage, as he returns to England to claim his rightful place in the aristocratic world of Ridley Court. His journey explores themes of identity and belonging as he navigates the complexities of his family legacy and the expectations of high society.  At the start of the narrative, we meet Gaston and his servant Jacques Brillon as they arrive in London, where they attract attention with their distinguished appearance and mannerisms. As they travel to Ridley Court, Gaston's humor and camaraderie with Jacques set the stage for their new life. The chapter introduces the enigmatic history of Gaston's father, Robert Belward, and hints at unresolved tensions within the Belward family, specifically regarding Sir William Belward and his estranged son. Through their conversations and encounters, Parker begins to weave a rich tapestry of Gaston's past and the challenges he will face as he attempts to reclaim his heritage in a society that may not readily accept him.
