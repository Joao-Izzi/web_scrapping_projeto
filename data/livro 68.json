    "resumo": "\"Freudian Slip\" by Franklin Abel is a science fiction novel written in the early 1950s. The story explores themes of reality, perception, and the complexities of the human psyche through the experiences of Herman Raye, an analyst who finds himself in a bizarre predicament when the Earth seemingly disappears. The narrative delves into philosophical questions about existence and memory, influenced by Freudian theories.  The plot follows Herman Raye, a psychoanalyst who, while enjoying a fishing trip, experiences a surreal event as the Earth vanishes beneath him. As he navigates a strange reality filled with peculiar beings, he learns that he has been summoned to help Primus, a creature representing the memory of Earth, who has suffered amnesia. Throughout the interactions with various surreal beings, including Secundus and the whimsical Hairy and Four-eyes, Herman struggles to assist Primus in regaining his lost memories, while grappling with the implications of his own existence. The novel is rich with humor and existential queries, ultimately concluding that while the process of analysis has freed Primus's inhibitions, it has also altered the world in disconcerting and whimsical ways.
