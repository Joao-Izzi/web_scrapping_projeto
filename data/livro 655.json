    "resumo": "\"Junto Al Pasig\" by José Rizal is a one-act melodrama written in verse, first performed in the late 19th century (specifically in the 1880s). This work serves as a celebration of the Filipino culture and the Marian devotion that is significant in the Philippines, set alongside the banks of the Pasig River. The book combines poetic dialogue with themes of good versus evil, represented through the characters’ interactions.  The story unfolds with children, including Leónido, Cándido, and Pascual, preparing to celebrate the feast of the Virgin Mary. Their joy and innocent banter are interrupted by the appearance of Satán, who represents temptation and evil. Leónido, however, embodies faith and purity, standing firm against Satán's attempts to sway him. As the drama escalates, angels intervene to protect Leónido, reinforcing the power of religious faith. Ultimately, the children celebrate the arrival of the Virgin Mary, highlighting themes of hope, goodness, and the protective nature of divine love against malevolent forces.
