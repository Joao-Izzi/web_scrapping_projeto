    "resumo": "\"With the Children on Sundays\" by Sylvanus Stall is a guidebook written in the early 20th century. The book aims to provide parents with practical methods to engage their children in meaningful religious experiences on Sundays, ensuring that the day is filled with joy and learning rather than dullness or drudgery. It contains a series of sermons meant to be shared with children, using everyday objects and experiences to teach important spiritual lessons.  At the start of the book, Stall emphasizes the importance of making Sundays a special day for families, contrasting the common perception of a dreary and tedious Sunday with the potential for happiness and spiritual enrichment. He recounts personal anecdotes and examples of families that successfully instilled a sense of joy and reverence for the day. The opening also outlines his method of using object lessons, like the story of the oyster and the crab, to illustrate concepts such as conscience and moral choices, intending to make spiritual teachings accessible and relatable for children.
