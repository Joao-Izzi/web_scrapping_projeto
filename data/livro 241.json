    "resumo": "\"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum is a fantasy novel written in the early 20th century. This delightful tale follows the adventures of young Ojo, who lives with his uncle in the heart of the enchanted Land of Oz, as he embarks on a quest to save his uncle and a magician's wife after they have been turned to marble.

Their journey leads them to the Crooked Magician, Dr. Pipt, who reveals the magical potential of the Powder of Life. When an accident occurs during the process of bringing the Patchwork Girl to life, Ojo finds himself on a quest for magical ingredients to restore his uncle and the magicianâ€™s wife. As they set off, Ojo, Scraps (the Patchwork Girl), and the Glass Cat navigate the wonders and challenges of Oz while uncovering the importance of friendship and courage in the face of adversity.
