    "resumo": "\"Systematic Theology (Volume 3 of 3)\" by Augustus Hopkins Strong is a theological treatise written in the early 20th century. Designed for theological students, this volume addresses Soteriology, or the doctrine of salvation, as presented through the work of Christ and the Holy Spirit. The focus is on various aspects of salvation, including election, calling, union with Christ, regeneration, conversion, justification, sanctification, and perseverance.  The opening of this volume introduces Soteriology and discusses the reconciliation of humanity to God through the application of redemption. It outlines several key sections, including the preparation for redemption involving election and calling, the actual beginning of salvation through union with Christ, and the continuation of salvation through sanctification and perseverance. The exploration of the doctrine of election is highlighted, emphasizing that it involves God's sovereign choice of certain individuals for salvation without regard to their anticipated behavior or merit, setting a foundational framework for the subsequent discussions on calling and further aspects of Soteriology.
