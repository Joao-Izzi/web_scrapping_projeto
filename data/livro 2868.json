    "resumo": "\"Al polo australe in velocipede\" by Emilio Salgari is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story centers around adventurous explorations to the South Pole, particularly following the characters Wilkye, an American velocipede enthusiast, and the Englishman Linderman, who engage in a heated debate about the feasibility of reaching the pole using bicycles rather than traditional ships. As they embark on their journey, they spar over national pride and scientific ambition, promising an exciting tale of rivalry and exploration.  At the start of the novel, we meet members of the American geographical society who discuss the recent failure of a polar expedition. This conversation ignites a challenging rivalry between the American Wilkye and the English Linderman. They eventually agree to lead separate expeditions to the South Poleâ€”Wilkye with his velocipedists and Linderman with his fast ship. The opening chapters set the stage for thrilling escapades, showcasing the characters' determination and comical personalities, particularly with the introduction of John Bisby, a comically overweight character eager to join the adventure for his own motives. As they prepare to set sail, the tone combines humor and anticipation, engaging readers with the promise of both perilous and potentially humorous situations.
