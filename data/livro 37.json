    "resumo": "\"The Amazing Interlude\" by Mary Roberts Rinehart is a novel written during the early 20th century, specifically around the time of World War I. The story focuses on Sara Lee Kennedy, a young woman in Pennsylvania, who, amid the turmoil of the Great War, grapples with her sense of duty, personal dreams, and the harsh realities faced by women and families during wartime. As her life in a quiet, uneventful city is disrupted by the conflict raging across the ocean, Sara Lee feels compelled to help, leading her on a journey of courage and self-discovery.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to Sara Lee, who is living a settled yet uneventful life, far removed from the chaos of war. As she reflects on the war and the loss of loved ones, she becomes increasingly troubled by the suffering in Europe and embarks on the ambitious plan to volunteer overseas. Sara Leeâ€™s character is fleshed out through her interactions with her family members and her quiet musings, revealing her growing restlessness and desire to make a difference despite societal expectations. Her resolve crystallizes as she prepares to leave her home and venture into the unknown, setting the stage for an extraordinary transformation wrought by the experiences that await her in wartime Europe.
