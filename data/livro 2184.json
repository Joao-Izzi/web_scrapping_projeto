    "resumo": "\"Leonie of the Jungle\" by Joan Conquest is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story seems to revolve around the experiences of a young girl named Leonie, who exhibits unusual behavior, including sleepwalking and vivid dreams filled with exotic imagery, partly influenced by her Indian heritage. The interactions she has with adults and her delicate emotional state suggest underlying themes of childhood innocence, trauma, and the complexities of growing up.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Leonie, a sensitive and imaginative seven-year-old girl who is upset over the death of her kitten. We see her communicate with the adults around her, particularly Sir Jonathan Cuxson, a brain specialist who appears to have a compassionate but firm demeanor. Throughout her interactions, Leonie's grief manifests in her imaginative tales of dreams that include tigers and a mysterious black woman. Her aunt, Lady Hetth, seems overwhelmed and anxious about Leonie's peculiarities, revealing both concern for her niece's well-being and her struggle with social expectations. The narrative hints at deeper issues related to Leonie's psyche and sets the stage for her emotional journey, underlining a stark contrast between the whimsical innocence of childhood and the more complex adult world surrounding her.
