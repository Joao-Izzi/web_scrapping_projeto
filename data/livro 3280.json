    "resumo": "\"Early Australian Voyages: Pelsart, Tasman, Dampier\" by John Pinkerton is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book recounts significant early voyages to Australia, particularly focusing on the explorations of Captain Francis Pelsart, Abel Tasman, and William Dampier. It aims to provide insights into the discoveries of the Australian continent and its varied natural resources, as well as the interactions between explorers and native populations.  The opening of the work sets the stage by contrasting the exploration of the Americas with that of Australia, highlighting the earlier imaginative tales that led to its discovery. Pinkerton introduces the figures of Pelsart, whose shipwreck opens the narrative, and states how subsequent explorations, particularly those of Tasman, contributed to the mapping and understanding of the southern continent. As the account progresses, it details Pelsart's hazardous voyage marked by shipwreck and survival challenges, while unraveling the complexities faced upon encountering indigenous peoples. Thus, the beginning provides a compelling glimpse into the maritime adventures that shaped the early European perception of Australia. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
