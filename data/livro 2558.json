    "resumo": "\"Trouble\" by George O. Smith is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around the complexities of human identity and the interactions between an engineer and his physicist alter ego, exploring themes of creativity and practicality within the realm of science. The narrative unfolds through the experiences of Tom Lionel, the consulting engineer who struggles with a split personality, leading to humorous and thought-provoking situations as both personas grapple with their conflicting approaches to problems.  The plot centers on Tom Lionel, who awakes to find his life complicated by the presence of his physicist counterpart, who continuously interferes with his practical work. As Tom navigates his daily life, he becomes increasingly frustrated with his physicist self's impractical theories and expensive whims, such as the purchase of a mass spectrograph that Tom deems unnecessary. The tension escalates when the physicist uses the laboratory equipment to delve into fantastical experiments, including the study of poltergeist phenomena and attempts to harness antigravity. The two personalities engage in an ongoing \"battle\" of intellects, ultimately leading to a realization that their coexistence may be more beneficial than previously thought as they confront unexpected scientific challenges together.
