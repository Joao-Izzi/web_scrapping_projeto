    "resumo": "\"Wij en ons ezeltje\" by Amy Le Feuvre is a novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story centers around a family consisting of several children who are dealing with the aftermath of their mother's death while their father, who serves as a vicar, grapples with the challenges of raising them in a new village. The driving force behind the children's antics is their determination to acquire an old donkey, leading them into various misadventures as they come up with plans to earn money.  At the start of the narrative, the eldest daughter, Grietje, introduces her family and recounts their recent move to a village, marking a new beginning filled with both excitement and sorrow. She describes her siblings: the clever and mischievous Daan, the thoughtful Alex, the playful Lena, and the youngest, Puf, who adds comical moments with his innocence. The children bond over their shared goal of buying a donkey, leading to spirited debates and clever ideas about earning money. The opening lays the groundwork for a heartwarming exploration of family life, resilience, and the youthful desire for adventure. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
