The book tells the story of a shipwreck and follows the experiences of various characters aboard the merchant ship De Vrede, particularly focusing on the second mate Flink and a family traveling on the ship, the Wilsons. Themes of adventure and survival at sea are central to the narrative, and the portrayal of maritime life offers a window into the challenges faced by sailors of the era.  At the start of the tale, we are introduced to the De Vrede as it struggles against a severe storm in the Atlantic Ocean. The captain, with his capable second mate Flink and the frightened young boy Willem, must navigate treacherous waters. Flink reassures Willem amidst the chaos, and we learn about his extensive experience at sea, emphasizing the potential dangers of nautical life. Alongside this, we meet the Wilson family, who are on board while the ship carries their cargo to New South Wales. As the storm intensifies, the narrative foreshadows impending disaster, setting the stage for the ship's fate and testing the resilience of the characters involved.
