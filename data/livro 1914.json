    "resumo": "\"Major Vigoureux\" by Arthur Quiller-Couch is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in a British garrison on a group of islands, centering around Major Narcisse Vigoureux, who serves as both the military governor and the chief civil magistrate. The narrative explores themes of duty, governance, and personal identity against a backdrop of bureaucratic negligence and social dynamics within the isolated community.  The opening of the novel introduces Major Vigoureux as he navigates the complexities of military life, marked by his interactions with his sergeants and the eccentricities of their situation. The Commandant is preoccupied with maintaining the dignity of his position while coping with the absurdity brought on by the Lord Proprietor and the lack of proper supplies for his men. As he grapples with issues ranging from clothing to social status, the narrative sets a tone of quiet tension and humor, revealing both the community's charm and the Commandant's inner conflict. The stage is set for further developments in the lives of both the Commandant and the inhabitants of the islands amidst the challenges they face. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
