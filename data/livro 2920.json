    "resumo": "\"Adonais\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley is an elegiac poem written in the early 19th century. The poem serves as a lament for the death of the poet John Keats, celebrating his life and artistic contributions while expressing profound grief over his untimely demise. The work is steeped in classical references and reflects Shelley's contemplations on mortality, loss, and the enduring nature of artistic legacy.  At the start of \"Adonais,\" Shelley introduces the theme of mourning through the character of Urania, who embodies the sorrow for the deceased, Adonais (representing Keats). The poem articulates the emotional landscape surrounding Keats's death while addressing the struggles and hardships faced by poets in a society that often overlooks their genius. As Urania mourns, the speaker reflects on the beauty and transience of life, ultimately concluding that, although Adonais has left this world, his spirit endures through his art and the natural world. This opening sets the stage for a rich exploration of beauty, loss, and the role of the poet as a mediator between life and death. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
