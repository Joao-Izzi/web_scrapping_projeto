    "resumo": "\"John Marvel, Assistant\" by Thomas Nelson Page is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around John Marvel, an ambitious and somewhat conceited young man navigating his college years and the social hierarchy of the time, while also delving into themes of friendship, prejudice, and personal failure. As he confronts various challenges, Marvel's relationships with his peers, especially with his Jewish roommate Wolffert, highlight the complexities of racial and cultural identities in that era.  At the start of the story, the protagonist reflects on his upbringing as the only surviving child from a distinguished family, setting the stage for his journey through college life. He recounts his initial failure to connect with his roommate, Wolffert, who faces discrimination as a Jew. This introduction establishes the social dynamics and the internal struggles of the characters, particularly Marvel's inadequacies contrasted with Wolffert's brilliance and determination. Their interactions set the tone for Marvel's self-discovery, as he begins to grapple with his own biases and the consequences of his actions. The opening chapters lay a foundation for exploring themes of identity and redemption throughout the novel. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
