    "resumo": "\"The Dark Door\" by Alan Edward Nourse is a science fiction novel likely written in the mid-20th century. This gripping narrative delves into themes of paranoia and the nature of reality, exploring the psychological turmoil faced by the protagonist, Harry Scott, as he is hunted by mysterious entities. It presents a dystopian world where science and mental health intertwine in a harrowing quest for knowledge and survival.  The storyline follows Harry Scott, an engineer who unravels a disturbing truth about the existence of beings that appear human but possess incredible abilities. As he becomes increasingly paranoid, he finds himself pursued by these entities, whom he believes want to kill him. His journey is further complicated by Dr. George Webber, a scientist who seeks to use Scott as a means to uncover deeper truths about insanity's rising tide in society. In a tense climax, Scott's struggle becomes not just for survival, but for his sanity as he encounters the blurred lines between reality and the horrors projected into his mind. As he navigates through treacherous encounters, he ultimately realizes that the real threat may not be the beings he fears, but rather those who seek to control his perception of reality, leading to exposure of a chilling conspiracy that questions the fabric of his existence.
