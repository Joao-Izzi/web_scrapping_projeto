    "resumo": "\"Daisy in the Field\" by Elizabeth Wetherell is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around a young girl named Daisy, who is grappling with the complexities of love and duty during a time of personal and national turmoil. As she navigates her feelings for Christian Thorold, a young officer in the Union Army, Daisy also faces the societal pressures of her family and their expectations regarding her future.  At the start of the novel, Daisy finds herself struggling with a flood of emotions after spending a night alone filled with thoughts of Christian, who is engaged in military duties. This emotional turmoil manifests as she attempts to focus on her studies, but the overwhelming feelings of grief and joy associated with Christian's affection leave her distracted and contemplative. The opening chapter highlights not only Daisy's inner conflicts but the backdrop of the Civil War, hinting at the challenges and dangers that will affect both her relationship and the larger world around her. As she interacts with her guardian Miss Cardigan and reflects on her circumstances, readers are drawn into a poignant exploration of love, loyalty, and the weight of impending conflict.
