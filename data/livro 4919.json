    "resumo": "\"The Little Angel and Other Stories\" by Leonid Andreyev is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. This work encapsulates the melancholy and introspection characteristic of Russian literature of that era, exploring complex themes of human emotion, suffering, and the pursuit of meaning in life. The stories often feature characters struggling against the harsh realities of their circumstances, providing insight into the darker aspects of existence.  The opening portion introduces readers to the character Sashka, a thirteen-year-old boy who feels trapped in a life filled with cruelty and neglect at home. Reflecting his rebellious spirit, Sashka finds solace in bullying his classmates and defying authority. As the narrative unfolds, he experiences a mix of emotions, from defiance against his mother to moments of longing for connection, ultimately leading him to a Christmas tree event where he encounters a small angel ornament that captivates him. This moment illustrates Sashka's deep yearning for beauty and innocence amid his troubled reality, setting the tone for the themes of hope and despair that permeate the stories.
