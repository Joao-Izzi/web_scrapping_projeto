    "resumo": "\"Plays of Near & Far\" by Lord Dunsany is a collection of dramatic works written in the early 20th century. This anthology presents a blend of fantasy and allegory, showcasing Dunsany's unique style, characterized by elaborate language and imaginative settings. The plays explore fantastical themes, often touching upon mythology, existential questions, and the nature of power through allegorical tales and rich characters.  The opening of the collection begins with a preface in which Dunsany explains his rationale for publishing his plays, despite traditionally allowing them to be judged by live audiences first. He offers insights into three specific plays: \"The Compromise of the King of the Golden Isles,\" \"The Flight of the Queen,\" and \"Cheezo.\" Each piece set the stage for thematic explorations of choice, destiny, and moral dilemmas, as exemplified by a king grappling with imperial edicts, a queen's enchanting call to a mystical mountain, and the satirical commentary on societal values through the character of Sladder, who is deeply entrenched in materialism and superficial food marketing.
