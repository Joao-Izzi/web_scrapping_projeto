    "resumo": "\"Agnes Bernauer\" by Friedrich Hebbel is a dramatic play written during the mid-19th century. The work centers on the tragic story of Agnes Bernauer, the daughter of a barber in Augsburg, whose beauty captivates hearts, including that of Duke Albrecht of Bavaria, setting the stage for a conflict between love and societal constraints.   The opening of the play introduces us to characters and the setting in Augsburg, where the bustling life of the period comes alive. We meet Theobald, a young barber’s apprentice, who grapples with his feelings for Agnes while also trying to navigate the complexities of his relationships with other townsfolk. Conversations reveal a playful yet tense atmosphere, hinting at deeper strife concerning Agnes’s burgeoning connection with Duke Albrecht, contrasted against the town's gossip and social hierarchies. Throughout the early scenes, themes of love, honor, and societal judgment begin to take shape, foreshadowing the tragic developments that will unfold as the story progresses.
