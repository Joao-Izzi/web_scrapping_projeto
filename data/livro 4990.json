    "resumo": "\"Geoffrey the Lollard\" by Frances Eastwood is a historical novel set in the late medieval period. The story centers around Geoffrey, the eldest son of a Lollard nobleman named John De Forest, as he and his younger brother Hubert navigate the dangers of a society steeped in religious persecution and the fight for the right to worship freely.

The beginning depicts their underground church setting, highlighting their fervent faith and the dangers they face from authorities. This opening portion sets the stage for both character development and the unfolding conflicts that will challenge their beliefs and bond as brothers as they strive to uphold their faith amid threats to their safety and freedom.
