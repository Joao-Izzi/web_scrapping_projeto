    "resumo": "\"The Making of Bobby Burnit\" by George Randolph Chester is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Robert Burnit, affectionately known as Bobby, who is thrust into the responsibilities of managing his father's legacy after John Burnit's death. Despite his initial lack of business acumen, Bobby is determined to uphold his father's business, the John Burnit Store, but he must navigate challenges from both within and outside the company, including deceitful competitors like Silas Trimmer.  The opening of the novel establishes Bobby's sudden transition from an idle heir to an unexpected business owner following his father's will, which outlines his path forward. This new responsibility is met with both excitement and trepidation as Bobby consults with Agnes Elliston, the woman he admires, for guidance. As Bobby interacts with various characters, including potential allies and adversaries, the narrative hints at conflicts arising from his naivety and the cutthroat world of business. The reader is introduced to the dynamics of Bobby's relationships and how they complicate his journey, setting the stage for both personal and professional growth as he navigates his newfound role.
