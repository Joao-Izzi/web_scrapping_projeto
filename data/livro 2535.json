    "resumo": "\"A Climber in New Zealand\" by Malcolm Ross is a mountaineering memoir written in the early 20th century. This work chronicles the authorâ€™s adventurous journeys and explorations in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, reflecting on both the challenges and breathtaking beauty of the mountainous landscapes. Ross describes his own experiences and those of other climbers, especially noting the significance of local peaks like Mount Cook.  At the start of the memoir, the author introduces the reader to the Southern Alps, emphasizing their grandeur and the lack of familiarity many have with New Zealand's climbing potential. He shares anecdotes about early explorers and climbers, particularly the Rev. William Spotswood Green's near-attempt at scaling Mount Cook, and describes the natural beauty of the region, including its flora, fauna, and glaciers. Ross paints a vivid picture of both the physical and psychological demands of alpine climbing, evoking a sense of adventure while laying the groundwork for the personal experiences that will unfold in the chapters ahead.
