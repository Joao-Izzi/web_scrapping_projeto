Its narrative delves into themes of desire, temptation, and the supernatural, exploring the struggles of a young priest caught between his sacred vows and an irresistible, otherworldly love. The story captures the tension between spiritual devotion and sensuality, underlining the potentially devastating impacts of unchecked passion.  The plot centers on Romuald, a priest who, after a moment of infatuation during his ordination, becomes entangled with Clarimonde, a stunningly beautiful woman who may be a demon or supernatural being. Their relationship unfolds in a dream-like, nocturnal world where Romuald experiences the dual existence of a devoted priest by day and a reckless nobleman by night.
