    "resumo": "\"Peeps at People\" by John Kendrick Bangs is a collection of humorous sketches written in the late 19th century. The work features various characters analyzed through the perspective of Anne Warrington Witherup, who embarks on whimsical interviews with a range of notable figures, blending satire and social commentary. The stories offer a comedic exploration of the personalities within the literary and artistic community of Bangs' time.  At the start of the book, the narrator sets off on a quest to interview prominent individuals, which begins with a humorous attempt to locate the polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen. Through a series of misadventures filled with misunderstandings and comedic dialogue, the narrator depicts Nansen's frosty demeanor and eccentricities, which encapsulate both his fame and his social quirks. This initial encounter lays the groundwork for the subsequent character studies and satirical glimpses into the lives of other notable figures like Hall Caine and Emperor William, emphasizing the humor inherent in the pursuit of celebrity and cultural figures.
