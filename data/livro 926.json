    "resumo": "\"Discours sur la nécessité et les moyens de détruire l'esclavage dans les colonies\" is a significant philosophical and political discourse authored by Mr. de Ladebat, who was a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Humanities, and Arts of Bordeaux. Written in the late 18th century, specifically in 1788, this work addresses the ethical and moral imperatives to abolish slavery within colonial territories. It emphasizes the need for reform in societal values regarding slavery, linking it to issues of human rights and justice.  In the discourse, de Ladebat provides a compelling argument against the institution of slavery, denouncing its moral, social, and economic ramifications. He meticulously outlines the historical context of slavery, highlighting its evolution and the injustices it perpetuates. De Ladebat also proposes a systematic approach for emancipation, advocating that slaves should gradually be transitioned to a form of servitude that could lead to their eventual freedom, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary skills and means to sustain themselves and contribute positively to society. He emphasizes that true economic productivity and moral integrity can only be achieved through the liberation and humane treatment of individuals, asserting that freedom is essential to the progress and wellbeing of society as a whole.
