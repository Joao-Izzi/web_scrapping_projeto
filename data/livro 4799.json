    "resumo": "\"The Lost Stradivarius\" by John Meade Falkner is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story revolves around John Maltravers, a talented violinist and student at Oxford, who encounters mysterious occurrences linked to an ancient piece of music and a ghostly figure who seems to be listening to his performances. The narrative explores themes of art, music, and the supernatural, weaving a tale filled with intrigue and suspense.  The opening of the novel introduces John Maltravers as a young man at Oxford in the early 1840s. It begins with a letter from his aunt, Sophia Maltravers, addressing significant events regarding his father that she plans to recount. As John navigates his life at university, he becomes involved in music with his friend William Gaskell, where strange occurrences, including the creaking of a wicker chair, are triggered while they play a peculiar piece of music called the \"Gagliarda.\" It becomes apparent that these occurrences are tied to an unseen presence that seems to be drawn to the music. As John deepens his attachment to this melody, the narrative hints at darker implications, setting a tone of suspense and foreshadowing as the story unfolds.
