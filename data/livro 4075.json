    "resumo": "\"The Big Bow Mystery\" by Israel Zangwill is a murder mystery novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the bizarre murder of Arthur Constant, found dead in a locked room, leading to a perplexing investigation that captivates public attention. It blends humor with the tension of a whodunit, exploring the lives surrounding the murder as characters grapple with the implications of the crime.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Mrs. Drabdump, a weary widow who runs a boarding house in Bow. The narrative quickly establishes the foreboding atmosphere of a foggy December morning when she realizes her lodger, Mr. Arthur Constant, has not responded to her morning wake-up call. Concerned, she calls upon Grodman, a retired detective living nearby, who bursts through the door only to discover Constant lying dead in his bed with his throat cut. The mystery deepens as all windows and doors are secured, leaving the investigators baffled about how a murder could have occurred in such a seemingly impossible scenario. This sets off a chain of inquiry filled with colorful characters and attempts to unravel the truth behind Constant's tragic demise. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
