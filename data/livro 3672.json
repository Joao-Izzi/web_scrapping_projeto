    "resumo": "\"Rule a Wife, and Have a Wife\" by John Fletcher is a comedy play written during the late 16th to early 17th century. The play revolves around themes of love, marriage, and the playful dynamics between men and women, focusing on characters like the comedic Juan de Castro and his compatriots who explore relationships in a humorous light.   The opening of the play introduces various characters discussing the troubles of recruitment for war and the prospects of marriage, especially regarding the wealthy heiress Donna Margarita. The scene kicks off with a conversation between Colonel Juan de Castro and his friend Michael Perez about military affairs and their romantic interests. Soon, two veiled ladies enter, setting the stage for a series of interactions that juxtapose military bravado with the intrigue of courtship. As characters express their desires and frustrations—especially concerning women’s pride and wealth—the groundwork is laid for the ensuing dramatic entanglements and comedic misunderstandings surrounding love and the roles of husbands and wives.
