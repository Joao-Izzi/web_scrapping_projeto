    "resumo": "\"A Trip to the Rockies\" by B. R. Corwin is a travelogue written during the late 19th century. The book chronicles a journey taken by a group of bankers and business professionals from New York to the scenic landscapes of the Rocky Mountains, emphasizing their experiences at various stops along the way and the vibrant beauty of the American West. It is a blend of personal narrative and commentary on the economic development observed throughout the travels, particularly in the states of Kansas and Colorado.  In this account, B. R. Corwin details not only the stunning natural beauty encountered during the trip but also the camaraderie among the travelers, highlighting their enjoyment of luxurious accommodations and fine dining aboard their special Pullman car, the \"Dalmatia.\" The narrative includes visits to significant cities, insights from prominent figures at a bankers' convention, and discussions on the financial prospects of the West, particularly in Kansas, which is characterized as rapidly growing and rich in resources like salt. Throughout the journey, the book captures both the intimate moments shared among the party members and the larger implications of their travels concerning business and the expansion of American society.
