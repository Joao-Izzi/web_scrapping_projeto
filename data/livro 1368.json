    "resumo": "\"Il libro di Sidrach: testo inedito del secolo XIV\" by Sidrac is a historical philosophical work written in the 14th century. This text explores themes of wisdom, theology, and magic through the narrative of its main character, Sidrach, who serves as a sage and advisor to kings. The work combines a variety of medieval concerns, reflecting the scholarly and superstitious nature of that period.  The opening of the book introduces Sidrach, a philosopher and prophet, recounting his knowledge and experiences during the reign of a character named Botozzo, a king seeking wisdom to overcome challenges. The story portrays Sidrach's divine inspiration and remarkable abilities, as he engages in debates about faith, divinity, and the nature of knowledge, all while addressing the concerns of Botozzo regarding the construction of a city. As the narrative unfolds, it hints at mystical themes intertwined with the quest for knowledge and the conflict between pagan beliefs and the worship of a singular deity, setting the stage for the exploration of wisdom, magic, and faith in the medieval context.
