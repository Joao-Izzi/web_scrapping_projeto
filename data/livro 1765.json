    "resumo": "\"Prose (1880-1890)\" by Cesare Pascarella is a collection of essays and writings penned during the late 19th century. The work explores the lives and experiences of various artists and models, depicting the exuberance, struggles, and tragedies inherent in the pursuit of art and personal expression in the cultural milieu of Italy.   The opening of the book introduces us to a crowded studio shared by artists living in a cramped attic beset by distractions, including a trombone-playing neighbor and the clang of a piano. The narrators, who are struggling artists, discuss the necessity of finding a suitable workspace, prompting them to explore different studios around Rome. They encounter a diverse mix of characters, including a melancholic painter contemplating a move to Naples and a group of eccentric artists with unique views on their craft. Through these interactions, Pascarella sets a humorous yet poignant tone that examines the precarious existence of artists and the relentless quest for artistic authenticity.
