    "resumo": "\"André\" by William Dunlap is a tragedy written during the late 18th century. This play explores the life and eventual execution of Major John André, a British spy during the American Revolutionary War. It delves into themes of honor, betrayal, and the moral complexities surrounding war and personal loyalties.  The narrative unfolds primarily through the character of André, who faces the consequences of his actions as he attempts to navigate the treacherous waters of espionage during a time of conflict. As he grapples with feelings of guilt and the ramifications of his allegiance to Benedict Arnold, André's emotions are mirrored by a young American officer, Bland, who struggles with his own loyalty to his country versus his friendship with André. The tension escalates with the arrival of news that Bland's father is also in jeopardy, further complicating the narrative. Ultimately, the play raises poignant questions about justice, sacrifice, and the heavy costs of war, culminating in André's execution and the painful reflections of those left behind.
