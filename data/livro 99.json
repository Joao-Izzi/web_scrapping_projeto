    "resumo": "\"Dr. Kometevsky's Day\" by Fritz Leiber is a science fiction story likely written in the early 1950s. Set in a time when astronomical phenomena and extraterrestrial events threaten the stability of the solar system, the book weaves together themes of existential dread, the nature of reality, and the intricate dynamics of relationships within a polygamous family. The narrative presents a speculative exploration of the consequences of cosmic shifts, drawing on both scientific theories and human emotions.  The story follows Celeste Wolver and her husband, Theodor, along with their extended family, as they grapple with mysterious disappearances of Mars' moons and a potential upheaval in the celestial order. As they investigate the phenomena linked to the predictions of the enigmatic Dr. Kometevsky, they confront their own insecurities and the fragility of their familial bonds. Themes of love, loyalty, and the search for security amidst chaos permeate the narrative, accentuated by the haunting dreams of their child, Dotty, who seems to possess a unique connection to cosmic events. As tensions escalate and the reality of their existence is challenged, the characters must face not only the imminent upheaval of their world but also the deeper meanings of their connections to each other and the universe.
