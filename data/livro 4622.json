    "resumo": "\"Coronation Rites\" by Reginald Maxwell Woolley is a scholarly treatise on the history and structure of the coronation ceremony within Christian liturgy written in the early 20th century. The book aims to explore the various rites associated with the coronation of monarchs, particularly focusing on their origins, developments, and unique characteristics across different cultures and historical contexts.  The opening of the text introduces the concepts of kingship and the religious ceremonies associated with the accession of a king, emphasizing the sacred duty attributed to rulers throughout history. Woolley discusses the intertwining of civil and religious responsibilities that characterize early kingship, illustrating this point through examples from several ancient civilizations, such as the Israelites and the Roman emperors. He sets the stage for an exhaustive examination of the evolution of coronation rites, mentioning significant sources and events that shape these transformative ceremonies across various cultures—including Byzantine, Eastern Orthodox, and Western tradition—while acknowledging the arbitrary nature of classifying the different recensions of the rites that have emerged over time.
