    "resumo": "\"Mjallhvít: Æfintýri Handa Börnum\" by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm is a classic fairy tale likely written in the early 19th century. This enchanting story revolves around themes of beauty, envy, and resilience in the face of adversity. It narrates the tale of a young girl, Mjallhvít (Snow White), who must navigate dangers introduced by her jealous stepmother, all while discovering friendship and protection from seven dwarfs.  The story begins with a queen who wishes for a daughter as pale as snow, red as blood, and black as ebony, and after her wish is granted, tragedy strikes as she dies shortly after childbirth. Growing up to be incredibly beautiful, Mjallhvít becomes the target of her stepmother's jealousy. The wicked queen orders a huntsman to kill her, but he spares her life. Alone in the forest, Mjallhvít finds refuge with seven dwarfs. However, the queen's malice continues as she attempts to kill Mjallhvít multiple times using poisoned gifts. After several close encounters and a period of apparent death, Mjallhvít is ultimately revived by a prince's kiss. Their love triumphs over evil, as the queen meets a fitting end, and Mjallhvít finds her happily ever after. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
