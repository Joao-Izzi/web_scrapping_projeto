    "resumo": "\"The Trimming of Goosie\" by James Hopper is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Charles-Norton Sims, affectionately called Goosie, as he navigates the inconsistencies between his aspirations for freedom and the demands of domestic life with his wife, Dolly. The opening chapters set the stage for Goosie's internal struggles as he grapples with awkwardness, unexpected changes, and peculiar physical developments that complicate his sense of identity.  At the start of the story, we are introduced to Goosie's morning routine, which includes a series of comical moments involving his calisthenics and his wife's innocent curiosity. As he heads out into the world, he becomes aware of a peculiar \"flapping\" behavior emerging within him, which he associates with a yearning for rebellion from his mundane life. The narrative unfolds with Goosie's reflections on his past, the emergence of wings from his shoulders, and the tension between expectation and reality that threatens his relationship with Dolly. This delightful blend of humor and introspection invites readers to consider the complexities of love, identity, and the desire for freedom. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
