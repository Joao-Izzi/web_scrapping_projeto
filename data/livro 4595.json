    "resumo": "\"The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge\" by John Fiske is an analytical treatise exploring the intersections of theology and modern scientific understanding, written in the late 19th century. The text addresses how the notion of God has evolved, particularly in light of advancements in scientific thought and the doctrine of evolution. Fiske aims to examine these changes critically, questioning whether concepts of pantheism can arise from modern interpretations of theism.  The opening of the book presents Fiske's reflections on the complexity of articulating the idea of God and the challenges such discussions pose for both the educated and the uneducated. He discusses the historical context in which notions of Deity were formed, drawing parallels between ancient beliefs and modern interpretations. Through an analysis of religious symbols, myths, and their relevance in contemporary thought, Fiske establishes a foundation for exploring more nuanced understandings of God that reconcile existing beliefs with modern knowledge. In doing so, he raises important questions about the nature of divine action, the relationship between science and religion, and how humanity can maintain a belief in God amidst rapid advancements in knowledge.
