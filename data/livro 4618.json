    "resumo": "\"Grimm's Fairy Stories\" by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm is a collection of classic fairy tales written during the early 19th century. This anthology features beloved stories such as \"Hansel and Gretel,\" \"Cinderella,\" and \"Snow White,\" capturing the imagination of readers with themes of magic, morality, and the struggles between good and evil. The tales often involve protagonists like young children, brave heroes, and vengeful queens, each facing unique challenges on their journeys.  The beginning of this collection introduces a selection of enchanting tales, starting with \"The Goose-Girl.\" An old queen's beautiful daughter sets out to marry a distant prince, accompanied by a maid who betrays her, forcing the princess into the guise of a servant. The narrative unfolds as the true identity of the princess is slowly revealed, hinting at themes of loyalty and justice. As the opening progresses, the tales of sibling dynamics in \"The Little Brother and Sister,\" the famous predicament of \"Hansel and Gretel\" in the woods, and the trials faced by characters in other stories set the tone for a magical journey filled with moral lessons and whimsical adventures. Each story promises intrigue, character transformation, and the eventual triumph of virtue, appealing to both children and adults alike. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
