    "resumo": "\"The Tournament—Its Periods and Phases\" by R. Coltman Clephan is a scholarly historical account written in the early 20th century. The book examines the tournament traditions practiced in medieval Europe, focusing on their origins, rules, and transformations over the centuries. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the social and martial significance of tournaments, informed by extensive research from various historical texts and records.  At the start of the work, the author sets the stage for a detailed examination of the tournament's history, emphasizing its roots in earlier martial exercises dating back to the eleventh century. Clephan outlines how these contests were not only displays of chivalric prowess but also served as vital training for warfare. He also notes the evolving regulations of tournaments and jousts from their chaotic beginnings to more structured events as chivalric values and societal norms developed. The opening chapters introduce key terms and concepts, such as \"hastiludia\" and \"behourd,\" as well as early references from chroniclers that highlight the interplay between tournaments and the political landscape of the time.
