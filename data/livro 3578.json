    "resumo": "\"The Staying Guest\" by Carolyn Wells is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers on two elderly maiden sisters, Miss Priscilla and Miss Dorinda Flint, who live in the stately but grim Primrose Hall. Their ordered lives are disrupted when a cheerful girl named Ladybird Lovell, the daughter of their estranged younger sister, unexpectedly arrives and demands to stay with them, leading to a clash of personalities and a comedy of manners.   At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Primrose Hall, a quaint and meticulously organized home, underscoring the sisters’ traditional and rigid ways. Their mundane routine is interrupted by the arrival of Ladybird, who espouses a vivacious and carefree spirit that stands in stark contrast to the Flints’ prim lifestyle. The lively child arrives after an uninvited letter indicates her circumstance as an orphan, bringing with her not only a playful disposition but also the companionship of a dog named Cloppy, much to Miss Priscilla’s chagrin. Their initial attempts to send her away only spark further antics and negotiations, setting the stage for a humorous exploration of family dynamics and the themes of love, acceptance, and the challenges of coexistence in the face of contrasting personalities.
