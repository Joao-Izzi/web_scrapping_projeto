    "resumo": "\"Vivian Grey\" by the Earl of Beaconsfield, Benjamin Disraeli, is a novel written during the early 19th century, capturing the complexities of social and political life in England. The story centers around the character Vivian Grey, an ambitious young man navigating his way through the intricate landscape of English high society, marked by vivid portrayals of various notable figures interacting within the social scene.  The opening portion of the book introduces us to Vivian Grey's early life and formative years. As the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Grey, Vivian is initially coddled and spoiled, leading to his enrollment in a private school, Burnsley Vicarage. We follow his evolution from a pampered boy into a young man whose talents and charm rapidly gain him popularity among his peers, despite some challenges and emerging conflicts. His school life is marked by theatrical aspirations and growing discontent with authority figures. At the end of the opening chapters, Vivian's journey towards self-discovery and ambition begins to unfold, setting the stage for his maneuvering through both societal expectations and personal aspirations.
