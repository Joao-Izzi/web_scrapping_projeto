    "resumo": "\"The Best of the World's Classics, Vol. V (of X) - Great Britain and Ireland III\" is a collection of prose works compiled by Henry Cabot Lodge, published in the early 20th century. The volume focuses on notable figures from British literature and history, particularly those active between the mid-18th century and the late 19th century, including James Boswell, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Sir Walter Scott. Through a selection of their writings, this anthology delves into the intellectual and cultural landscape of Great Britain and Ireland during this period.  At the start of this volume, the content introduces James Boswell's encounter with Dr. Samuel Johnson, providing insights into their personalities and the contrasting dynamics of their relationship. Boswell expresses his eagerness to meet Johnson and captures the awkwardness of their initial interaction as well as Johnson's sharp wit. This opening segment showcases Boswell's admiration for Johnson and sets the tone for a deeper exploration of Johnson's life and ideas, effectively illustrating the themes of friendship, literary legacy, and the complexities of character that will unfold throughout the collection.
