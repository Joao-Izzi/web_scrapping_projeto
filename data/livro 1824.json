    "resumo": "\"Moral Tales\" by Madame Guizot is a collection of moral stories written in the early 19th century. The tales aim to engage young readers with relatable narratives featuring children as main characters, ultimately guiding them toward important moral lessons without overt lecturing.\"   \"At the start of the book, the narrative is introduced through the character of Ernestine, a young girl fascinated by a moving picture that she wishes to have. Her father uses the story of a particular \"louis d'or,\" a gold coin, to explain its significance and the various adventures it has undergone. The tale unfolds in a series of vignettes that reveal the far-reaching effects of seemingly small actions and the moral lessons connected to the coin's journey, illustrating how it impacts the lives of several characters, including a soldier, a poor peasant, and a child named Peter.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
