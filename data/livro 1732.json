    "resumo": "\"The Book of Evelyn\" by Geraldine Bonner is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Evelyn Drake, a widow in her thirties who has recently moved back to New York City after several years in Europe. Struggling to find her place in the urban environment and grappling with her past, Evelyn navigates her new life and the challenges of living in a modest apartment while dealing with societal expectations and her own desires.  The opening of the novel introduces Evelyn as she settles into her new home, a small furnished apartment in a brownstone. She reflects on her surroundings, the contrasts between her old life and her current situation, and her longing for connection in a bustling city that often feels indifferent. As she settles in, she learns about her fellow tenants, particularly Miss Harris, a vibrant aspiring singer, which hints at the complexities of relationships and the struggles of those who share her environment. Evelyn's observations about her life and surroundings set the stage for themes of loneliness, ambition, and societal roles that unfold throughout the story.
