    "resumo": "\"Cinq Semaines en Ballon\" by Jules Verne is a novel written during the early 19th century. The story centers around Dr. Samuel Fergusson, an audacious explorer determined to traverse Africa via a hot air balloon, which promises to connect previous geographic discoveries in the continent and push the boundaries of exploration.  The opening of the novel captures a dramatic scene at the Royal Geographical Society in London, where Dr. Fergusson is introduced amidst applause following an inspiring speech by the president. We learn of Fergussonâ€™s impressive background as a seasoned traveler, shaped by adventure and explorations across the far reaches of the globe. The excitement and skepticism surrounding his ambitious plan to fly across Africa fill the air, setting the stage for the challenges and adventures that lie ahead. It hints at the deep friendship with his companion Dick Kennedy, who is more reluctant about this risky endeavor, and introduces the tension between their differing views on adventure and safety.
