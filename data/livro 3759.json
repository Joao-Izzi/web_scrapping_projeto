    "resumo": "\"Geology of Devils Tower National Monument, Wyoming\" by Charles Sherwood Robinson is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. This book delves into the geological features and history of Devils Tower, an iconic geological formation in Wyoming. It provides a comprehensive overview of the Tower's structure, the types of rocks present in the area, and the geological processes that have shaped the landscape over various geological periods.  The book begins with an introduction to the significance of Devils Tower, emphasizing its status as the first national monument established by President Theodore Roosevelt. It describes the Tower's composition, primarily igneous rock termed phonolite porphyry, and outlines the various sedimentary formations surrounding it, dating from the Triassic to the Jurassic period. Robinson discusses the geological history of the region, highlighting theories regarding the Tower's origin, including its potential classification as a volcanic neck or an intrusive igneous body connected to a deeper magma chamber. Additionally, the book elaborates on the geological processes such as erosion, faulting, and the structural characteristics of the rock formations, supported by illustrations and maps that provide visual context.
