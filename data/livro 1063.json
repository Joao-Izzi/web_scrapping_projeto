The book is likely to attract readers interested in Italy's rich historical tapestry, especially those keen on the interplay of power and military strategies.  At the start of this volume, the focus is on the political turmoil in Milan during the early 16th century, marked by the presence of the French invasions and the ambitions of various leaders, including Francesco II Sforza. Verri highlights significant events such as the coalition against the French forces, the impact of natural disasters that were interpreted as omens, and the rising defiance of Milanese citizens.
