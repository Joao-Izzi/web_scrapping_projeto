    "resumo": "\"Essays of Michel de Montaigne — Volume 10\" by Michel de Montaigne is a collection of essays written in the late 16th century that reflects on various themes of human experience and knowledge. Montaigne's work delves into complex ideas such as honor, paternal affection, and the nature of books, illustrating his deep philosophical inquiries and personal reflections on these subjects.  The opening of the volume introduces a series of essays that tackle ideas about the nature of honor and recompense, especially in the context of military and social accolades. Montaigne discusses historical figures like Augustus Caesar to explore how societies have honored virtue, suggesting that true honor should be rare and free from commodification. He laments the dilution of honor through common practice and critiques the contrasting values found in how humans nurture their children, revealing a richer layer of emotional complexity in familial relationships. This initial section sets the stage for Montaigne’s introspective style and establishes the personal and societal themes he will continue to examine throughout his essays.
