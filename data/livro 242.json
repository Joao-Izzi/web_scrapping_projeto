    "resumo": "\"From Snotty to Sub\" by Wolston B. C. W. Forester is a naval memoir written in the early 20th century. This work chronicles the experiences of young British naval officers during World War I, focusing on the transitions and challenges faced by the main character, who is a Midshipman, as he rises to the rank of Sub-Lieutenant. The narrative paints a vivid picture of naval life, camaraderie, and the harrowing events during the war, providing a glimpse into the world of young men tasked with serving on the front lines of a brutal conflict.  At the start of the memoir, the author provides a foreword explaining the challenges involved in documenting the Midshipman's journey due to wartime restrictions on diary-keeping. The opening chapter describes the protagonist's assignment to H.M.S. \"C——\", a super-Dreadnought, and his experiences settling into life aboard the ship, including meeting fellow Midshipmen and participating in naval routines. A significant event during this early period is a tragic picnic that leads to the loss of a fellow officer, highlighting the duality of joy and sorrow faced by those in military service. The opening sets the tone for a narrative filled with exploration of personal growth amid the tumult of war. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
