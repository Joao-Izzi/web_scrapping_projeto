    "resumo": "\"Diary of Richard Cocks, Volume 2\" by Richard Cocks is a historical account written in the early 17th century. This volume chronicles the experiences of Richard Cocks, a Cape-Merchant in the English factory in Japan, during his time from 1615 to 1622. The diary offers insight into the daily operations of the trading post, detailing transactions, personal interactions, and cultural observations of Japan during this period.  The opening of the diary sets the stage for Cocksâ€™ detailed recounting of his daily life and business dealings in Japan. It initiates with the New Year, where he discusses the exchange of gifts and financial transactions, including bills for trades involving silk and other goods. Cocks provides a glimpse into the complexities of trade negotiations, his interactions with Japanese and Chinese merchants, the relationships he builds within the community, and the challenges posed by local customs, legal disputes, and the navigation of interpersonal politics among various nationalities involved in trade. The perspective presented in this initial portion enriches our understanding of early international commerce and cultural exchange in a time when such interactions were becoming increasingly significant.
