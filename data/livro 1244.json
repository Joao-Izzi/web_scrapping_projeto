The story revolves around the intriguing concept of a time prison set in the archaeozoic era, where the protagonist, Adam Slade, sees no hope of escape from the bleak reality of his situation. Facing imminent execution, he takes a desperate gamble to free himself, only to learn that the harsh, primordial world outside offers its own set of dangers.  The plot unfolds as Adam Slade escapes from his time prison with Marcia Lawrence, a reporter who had come to interview him prior to his execution. The two navigate a desolate landscape dominated by molten rock and primordial seas, struggling to evade capture amidst brutal storms. As they attempt to double back to the prison and access a time machine, Sladeâ€™s intentions become increasingly ambiguous, leading to tension and conflict between the two.
