    "resumo": "\"War and the Future: Italy, France and Britain at War\" by H. G. Wells is a historical account written during the early 20th century, likely around the time of World War I. The book examines the experiences and realities of warfare, particularly focusing on the conflict in the Italian front, as well as broader themes relating to public opinion, the social implications of war, and the profound human impacts of this global conflict.  The opening portion of the work sets the stage for a critical exploration of warfare's complexities through a personal lens. Wells reflects on the importance of public opinion in shaping perceptions of the war and discusses his own experiences as an observer traveling through the front lines. He grapples with the disconnect between the heroism often glorified in wartime narratives and the harsh, chaotic realities faced by soldiers and civilians. Wells underscores the futility and destruction of modern warfare, introducing themes of pacifism and collective humanity over individual glorification. This portion establishes the groundwork for a more nuanced discussion of the social and psychological effects of the war as the narrative continues. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
