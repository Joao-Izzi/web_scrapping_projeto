    "resumo": "\"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota\" by L. David Mech et al. is a scientific publication written in the early 1970s. This work focuses on the ecological aspects, behavior, and movements of the timber wolf population in northern Minnesota, aiming to provide insights into their habitat and conservation needs amidst growing ecological concerns. The publication seeks to advance the understanding of wolf ecology during a time when wolves faced declining populations and were considered endangered.  At the start of the study, the authors establish the significance of the timber wolf population in northeastern Minnesota and the environment in which they exist, particularly within the Superior National Forest. It details the research methodology, which includes aerial tracking and behavior observations of various wolves over multiple field seasons. The opening emphasizes the historic context of previous research, the current status of the timber wolf population, and introduces the range and social dynamics of wolves observed during the study, highlighting the complexities of their movements and interactions with their environment.
