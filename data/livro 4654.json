    "resumo": "\"Acid Bath\" by Vaseleos Garson is a science fiction story likely written in the early 1950s. The narrative follows Jon Karyl, a Lone Watcher stationed on an asteroid, who finds himself confronting mysterious invaders known as the Steel-Blues. The story delves into themes of survival and ingenuity in the face of extraterrestrial threat, featuring Karyl's desperate attempts to warn Earth as he becomes a subject of experimentation by the aliens.  As the plot unfolds, Karyl encounters the Steel-Blues, who reveal their intent to invade Earth for its resources. They subject him to a mysterious liquid they call \"hemlock,\" which is intended to dissolve metal but unexpectedly allows Karyl to survive due to his organic composition. The tension builds as Karyl frantically sends a distress signal to the Space Patrol, racing against time to inform them of the impending invasion. In a twist, the aliens misjudge Karyl's resilience to their \"torture,\" and ultimately, their downfall comes at the hands of the SP ship, which retaliates using water against the metallic creatures. The story concludes with Karyl's victory over his captors and a hint of the unknown origins of the Steel-Blues. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
