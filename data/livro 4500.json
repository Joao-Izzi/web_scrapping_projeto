    "resumo": "\"The Rules of the Game\" by Stewart Edward White is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in the late 19th century and revolves around the world of lumbering in the American wilderness, exploring themes of ambition, industry, and the transition from youthful dreams to adult realities. The main characters include Jack Orde, a man wrestling with his business aspirations and the future of his son, Bob, who is stepping into the world of work while trying to figure out his identity and role in a demanding business landscape.  The opening of the book introduces us to Jack Orde and his reunion with Welton, an old friend, as they prepare for a duck-hunting trip. Their banter establishes their familiarity and sets the tone for their friendship, which is rooted in their shared past in the lumber industry. This initial setting is rich with descriptions of the natural environment and the camaraderie between the two men, as they discuss family and business aspirations. Bob Orde later enters the narrative as he embarks on his own journey in the lumber company, facing the monotony of office life and grappling with the pressure to prove himself. The stage is set for a contrast between the vibrant outdoor world and the bureaucratic constraints of business as Bob begins to realize the challenges of adulthood and the expectations placed upon him.
