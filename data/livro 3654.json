    "resumo": "\"Goslings\" by J. D. Beresford is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the Gosling family, particularly George Gosling, an ostensibly respectable middle-class man navigating the societal norms and expectations of his time, while being blissfully unaware of the turbulent inner lives and desires that lie beneath the surface of his routine existence. The initial chapters set the stage for a profound exploration of human behavior, social dynamics, and the brewing threat of a new plague that is hinted to escalate, possibly disrupting their seemingly mundane world.  The opening of \"Goslings\" introduces us to George and his wife, who are engaged in a familiar domestic banter while anticipating the return of their daughters from a shopping trip. We learn about George's rise from humble beginnings to a stable middle-class life but also catch glimpses of his hidden desires and the delicate balance between his respectability and suppressed urges. As the family prepares for another evening at home, news of a concerning \"new plague\" spreading in China and reported cases in Russia begins to emerge, foreshadowing the larger crisis that will invade their lives. Through lively dialogue and character development, the first chapters establish the underlying tensions of personal and societal conflict that will likely unravel as the plot progresses.
