    "resumo": "\"The Floors of the Ocean: 1. The North Atlantic\" by Bruce C. Heezen, Marie Tharp, and Maurice Ewing is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. This detailed work focuses on the physiographic characteristics of the North Atlantic Ocean, exploring various submerged features and their geological significance. Through the use of continuous echo-sounding data, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ocean floor's topography and its relation to geological structures.  The opening of this publication sets the stage for an extensive analysis of the North Atlantic's underwater terrain, described through a meticulously prepared physiographic diagram. It outlines the methods used for data collection and presents an overview of the different categories of oceanic features, such as the continental margin, ocean-basin floor, and mid-oceanic ridges. The foreword discusses the ongoing efforts in marine geology, illustrating how past studies have informed the current understanding of oceanic physiography while acknowledging the need for continued exploration in these underwater landscapes. This foundational information lays the groundwork for the detailed analysis and implications of the ocean's depths that will follow in subsequent sections.
