    "resumo": "\"Three People\" by Pansy is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows three boys—Pliny Hastings, Bennie Phillips, and Tode Mall—who share a birthday but grow up in vastly different circumstances. Pliny is the son of a wealthy liquor dealer, Bennie is raised in a more modest household, and Tode comes from a struggling, impoverished background, living in a rough environment. The book explores themes of social class, the impact of wealth on character, and the stark differences in their lives.  At the start of the novel, the narrative introduces baby Pliny L. Hastings, celebrating his first birthday amid luxury and joy, while just a mile away, Tode Mall crawls in a filthy cellar, unaware of the significance of his own birth. Following these contrasting beginnings, we meet the Phillips family that thinks fondly of their son Bennie yet may not have the means to celebrate him the way Pliny's family does. The opening chapters set the stage for the importance of the characters' socioeconomic backgrounds and how these influences shape their identities and futures. The groundwork is laid for a deeper exploration of the consequences of their upbringings as the story progresses. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
