    "resumo": "\"Hedda Gabler\" by Henrik Ibsen is a play in four acts written during the late 19th century. This dramatic work revolves around the complex character of Hedda Tesman, newly married and struggling with her identity and ambitions in a stifling domestic life. The narrative explores themes of societal expectations, personal freedom, and the inner turmoil of its characters, particularly focusing on Hedda's conflict between her desires and the limitations imposed by her marriage and society.  The opening of \"Hedda Gabler\" introduces the setting—a spacious drawing room—where Miss Juliana Tesman and Berta, a servant, discuss the arrival of Hedda and her husband, George Tesman, after their wedding trip. As George enters with excitement about his scholarly pursuits, the dynamic of their relationship unfolds, revealing Hedda's discomfort and hints at her discontent with the domestic life that now defines her. The conversation touches on her refinement and social expectations, as well as her apparent detachment from her surroundings. The arrival of Thea Elvsted introduces another layer to the story, hinting at a past connection with Eilert Lovborg, who is suggested to be a central character in the unfolding drama. This initial scene sets the tone for the tensions and complications that will arise in Hedda's life as the narrative progresses, focusing on her struggle against the constraints of her environment and her own aspirations.
