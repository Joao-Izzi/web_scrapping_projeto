    "resumo": "\"Diana of the Crossways — Complete\" by George Meredith is a novel written during the late 19th century. It explores the life of Diana, a young woman of notable beauty and wit hailing from an illustrious Irish family, who finds herself the subject of scandal and societal scrutiny. The narrative delves into themes of reputation, femininity, and societal expectation, particularly as Diana navigates her relationships and the challenges posed by her independent spirit in a male-dominated society.  The opening of the novel introduces the heroine through a series of diaries and accounts from those who encounter her, highlighting her impact on their lives with her charm and intellect. As the narrative unfolds, it becomes clear that Diana's beauty is both a blessing and a curse, drawing admiration while inciting jealousy and criticism. In particular, we see her at an Irish ball where her presence captivates the attention of influential men, including the veteran General Lord Larrian and the earnest but unassuming Mr. Thomas Redworth. The interplay of these relationships sets the stage for Diana's struggles with societal constraints and personal desires, emphasizing the author's critique of gender dynamics and the complexities of emotional connection.
