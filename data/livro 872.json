    "resumo": "\"Der Gehülfe\" by Robert Walser is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book follows Joseph Marti, a young man who has recently started a job with an engineer named Tobler, and explores themes of employment, social dynamics, and self-identity within a new environment.   The opening of the novel introduces Joseph as he arrives at the Tobler household on a rainy morning, carrying a modest suitcase. His initial interactions with his new employer, Tobler, reveal a strained yet comical beginning, as Tobler expresses frustration at Joseph's early arrival despite the fact that it was a misunderstanding. As Joseph settles into his new role, he finds himself grappling with feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about his capabilities. Meanwhile, he is introduced to Tobler's family, including his wife and children, who view Joseph as a curiosity. These early scenes set up the complexities of Joseph's life as he attempts to acclimate to both the work and social environment within the Tobler household.
