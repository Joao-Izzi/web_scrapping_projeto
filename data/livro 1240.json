    "resumo": "\"The Box-Car Children\" by Gertrude Chandler Warner is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers on four siblings—Henry, Jess, Violet, and Benny—who decide to run away after their father’s death and the fear of being sent to live with an unkind grandfather. As they embark on their adventure, they discover the significance of resilience, resourcefulness, and familial bonds while facing various challenges in their quest for safety and stability.  At the start of the story, the children are introduced as they flee from their troubles, determined to make a life for themselves without adult supervision. Following their father's passing, they find themselves in a precarious situation with an alcoholic father and no mother. As they navigate their journey, they carefully gather provisions, find hiding places, and work together to survive. The opening chapters set a tone of adventure and innocence, laying the groundwork for their subsequent trials and discoveries as they establish a home in an old freight car.
