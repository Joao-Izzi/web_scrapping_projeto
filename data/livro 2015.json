    "resumo": "\"The Human Species\" by A. de Quatrefages is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work delves into the study of humanity from an anthropological perspective, exploring the unity and diversity of the human species, including discussions on race, variation, and the classification of man within the natural kingdoms.   At the start of the text, the focus is on establishing a clear understanding of how to classify living beings and the differences between inanimate and organized entities. De Quatrefages introduces the concept of kingdoms of nature and discusses the challenges of categorizing man among other species. He asserts the importance of examining humanity through the lens of scientific observation and comparison with the animal and plant kingdoms, as he lays the groundwork to argue for the unity of the human species while addressing debates about the distinctions among races. This opening portion sets a framework for the exploration of complex topics related to human variation, its origins, and its implications for understanding humanity as a whole.
