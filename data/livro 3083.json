    "resumo": "\"The Castle of Twilight\" by Margaret Horton Potter is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set in a medieval world, it delves into the themes of love, loss, and the struggles of its characters, particularly focusing on Madame Eleanore and her daughter Laure. The story unfolds within the confines of the castle, which serves as a backdrop for the poignant interplay of personal and societal expectations, especially regarding faith and familial duties.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Eleanore, the châtelaine of Le Crépuscule, who grapples with deep sorrow as her daughter, Laure, enters a convent, marking a significant separation from her life as a mother. The atmosphere is heavy with melancholy as Eleanore reflects on her past and the loneliness that looms over her now that her beloved daughter is destined for a life in the Church. The opening pages paint a vivid portrait of the castle life against the backdrop of the social constraints of the time, setting the tone for a tale rich in emotional resonance and exploration of the inner lives of its characters. As Eleanore navigates her grief, she encounters her son Gerault and the complexities of their relationships are further drawn out, hinting at impending emotional turmoil in both their lives.
