    "resumo": "\"Rosalynde; or, Euphues' Golden Legacy\" by Thomas Lodge is a pastoral romance written in the late 16th century. The narrative centers around the character of Rosalynde, the daughter of an exiled king, who finds herself entangled in themes of love, honor, and familial discord. The work notably serves as a precursor to Shakespeare's \"As You Like It,\" showcasing the intricacies of courtly life alongside the simpler existence of shepherds.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Sir John of Bordeaux, a nobleman reflective on his impending death, who imparts wisdom and a legacy to his three sons. The opening chapter emphasizes the importance of virtue and honor, as well as foreshadowing conflict among the brothers, particularly with Saladyne's jealousy over Rosader. Sir John's death sets the stage for ensuing tensions, especially as Rosader strives for honor in a wrestling tournament, while Rosalynde grapples with her love for him amidst her own challenges. This opening portion eloquently sets the tone for a story filled with romance, adventure, and the exploration of human emotions intertwined within the framework of Elizabethan societal norms.
