    "resumo": "\"The Lighted Match\" by Charles Neville Buck is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the themes of love and duty, focusing on the character Cara, who struggles with the demands of her royal heritage and her desires for personal freedom. Through her interactions with Benton, the novel unfolds a mix of romantic entanglements and societal expectations.  At the start of the novel, a young man and woman wash their hands in a common basin, while a farmer shares a local superstition, hinting at the relationship dynamics between them. The young man, Benton, appears to be charmed by the vibrant young woman, Cara, who expresses a longing for freedom from the constraints that come with her potential marriage to a foreign prince. As they ride in the autumn sunset, their playful banter reveals the depth of their connection, contrasted with Caraâ€™s hidden worries about her royal obligations and the presence of Pagratide, a suitor she is expected to choose. The opening sets a tone of romantic tension and foreshadows the struggle between societal expectations and personal desires that will shape the rest of the narrative.
