    "resumo": "\"At the Deathbed of Darwinism: A Series of Papers\" by Eberhard Dennert is a collection of critical essays written in the early 20th century. The work examines and challenges the principles of Darwin's theory of evolution, particularly natural selection, suggesting that the scientific consensus is shifting away from Darwinism. Dennert presents the viewpoints of various scientists who argue for alternative explanations of evolution that align more closely with theistic principles.  The opening of the book sets the scene for a comprehensive critique of Darwinism, drawing attention to the growing skepticism within the scientific community about the validity of natural selection as a mechanism for evolution. Dennert highlights a series of papers that underscore the inadequacies of Darwin's theories and discusses the positions of contemporary biologists and paleontologists who propose different models of evolutionary change. Central to this discussion is the assertion that many adaptations observed in nature cannot solely be explained by the struggle for existence or random variations, indicating a need for a more nuanced understanding of biological development.
