    "resumo": "\"The Burgomaster's Wife — Volume 03\" by Georg Ebers is a historical novel likely written in the late 19th century. The narrative revolves around Maria, the wife of Burgomaster Van der Werff, who is navigating the challenges of her domestic duties amid the backdrop of political tensions and social upheaval in a city facing threats from the Spanish army. The story delves into themes of resilience, duty, and the interpersonal dynamics within a community grappling with the imminent danger of war.  The opening of the novel establishes a critical moment as Maria prepares for a meeting at her home with local officials to discuss the city’s defense strategies against a possible siege. While she seems to find joy in fulfilling the traditional role of a hostess, her happiness is tinged with anxiety about the political climate and her lonely existence. As she decorates the dining table with flowers and fine dishes, the narrative reflects her longing for deeper connections with people. In an unexpected turn, she is drawn into a significant role when Doctor Bontius summons her to aid a sick young woman, Henrica, leading to a blend of personal and communal challenges. The sense of foreboding is palpable as news of the Spanish threat looms, setting the stage for an exploration of courage, loyalty, and the complexities of duty in times of crisis.
