    "resumo": "\"The Annals of the Parish\" by John Galt is a fictional narrative written in the early 19th century. The book presents the autobiographical account of Rev. Micah Balwhidder, the minister of the parish of Dalmailing, chronicling his experiences, observations, and the lives of his parishioners during his ministry. The unfolding story captures the essence of community life, with insights into social, religious, and economic matters of the period.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Rev. Balwhidder as he reflects on the significance of his appointment as the minister of Dalmailing, which coincides with the start of King George III's reign. He recounts the emotional farewell to his congregation, who express profound sorrow at his departure after years of service. Through his reminiscences, we are introduced to various characters, such as Mrs. Malcolm, a widow trying to support her five children, and the tumultuous beginning of Balwhidder's ministry marked by local resistance and personal trials. The narrative sets the tone for a detailed exploration of the parish's history, community conflicts, and societal changes during the 18th century, ultimately painting a rich picture of human perseverance and faith amidst challenges.
