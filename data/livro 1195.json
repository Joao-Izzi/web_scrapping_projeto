    "resumo": "\"Modern Magic\" by M. Schele de Vere is a philosophical exploration of mystical phenomena and beliefs, likely written in the late 19th century. The work examines the notion of magic as a potential manifestation of human powers that transcend ordinary natural laws, positioning itself within the context of both scientific inquiry and spiritual understanding. The subject matter delves into various aspects of what is commonly perceived as magic, such as witchcraft, necromancy, and the metaphysical abilities attributed to human beings.  The opening of the book sets the stage for an exploration into the nature of magic, emphasizing the importance of discerning truth from superstition. Schele de Vere argues for the validity of extraordinary human abilities, suggesting that these powers can lie dormant or be mischaracterized as mere delusions. The preface lays a solid philosophical foundation, inviting readers to reconsider established perceptions of magic and encouraging thoughtful examination of spiritual phenomena. It addresses the intersection of spirituality and the material world, ultimately suggesting a deeper relationship between mankind and the mysteries of nature, hinting at a journey from skepticism toward enlightenment.
