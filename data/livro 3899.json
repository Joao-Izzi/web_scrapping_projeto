    "resumo": "\"The Chaplain of the Fleet\" by Walter Besant and James Rice is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story begins with the poignant life of a young girl named Kitty Pleydell, who has recently lost her father, a kind and pious clergyman. As she navigates her grief, she is thrust into a world of uncertainty and adventure, compelled to seek out her uncle in London as per her father's last wishes.  At the start of the book, we witness Kitty's deep sorrow as she mourns her father's death, reflecting on his life and their shared moments. In the aftermath of the funeral, Kitty must come to terms with her new reality—a life devoid of parental guidance and filled with new responsibilities. She learns about her inheritance, including a sum of money hidden in her father’s belongings, and is determined to follow his final instructions, leading her to London. The opening chapters set the stage for Kitty's journey as she prepares to leave her rural home, highlighting her innocence, courage, and the great unknown that awaits her.
