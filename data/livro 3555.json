    "resumo": "\"Told by the Colonel\" by W. L. Alden is a collection of humorous short stories written in the late 19th century. The tales are narrated by a character known as the Colonel, who shares amusing anecdotes and observations about life, revealing eccentric characters and absurd situations. The overarching themes often touch on human folly, social commentary, and the humorous aspects of everyday life.  At the start of the book, readers are introduced to the Colonel as he sits in a Paris hotel, surrounded by a group of Americans who engage in boisterous discussions about their experiences in the city. The Colonel, initially quiet, draws attention when he requests an owl, prompting him to share the story of a parrot his daughter owned. This parrot, with its insatiable chatter and lack of regard for others, serves as the basis for an amusing narrative that highlights the Colonel's dry wit and skills as a storyteller. The opening portion sets the tone for the forthcoming tales, hinting at the mix of humor and critique that defines the Colonel's observations throughout the collection.
