    "resumo": "“Memoirs of the Court of Louis XIV. and of the Regency — Volume 03” by Orléans is a historical account likely written in the early 18th century. The work offers a vivid glimpse into the intrigues, personal relationships, and political maneuverings within the French royal court during the time of Louis XIV and the subsequent regency, focusing particularly on the life and experiences of Madame Elizabeth-Charlotte of Bavaria, the Duchess of Orléans. The memoirs delve into the complexities of royal marriages, familial loyalty, and the machinations of power and jealousy that characterized the court.  At the start of the memoir, the author reflects on the life of Henrietta of England, Monsieur's first consort, outlining her unhappiness amidst betrayal from those close to her. The narrative details her struggles, particularly her relationships with influential figures, including Monsieur and the Chevalier de Lorraine, leading to her eventual tragic fate. The text paints a portrait of Madame through the eyes of her confidante, highlighting the entangled dynamics at the court, as well as the political relationships that developed and crumbled with every whispered secret and betrayal, setting the stage for further intrigue in the volume.
