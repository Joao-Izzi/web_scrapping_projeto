    "resumo": "\"A Philosophical Dictionary, Volume 03\" by Voltaire is a philosophical treatise collection written in the 18th century. This work dives into a variety of topics, including morality, ethics, and observations on human nature, religion, and society through the lens of philosophical inquiry. It aims to challenge conventional thoughts and provoke critical reflection on the customs and beliefs of mankind.  The opening of the volume addresses the concept of cannibalism, juxtaposing the act of consuming human flesh with prevailing cultural practices of violence and war. Voltaire examines historical references and accounts from various cultures, suggesting that the act of killing in battle often leads to the same moral considerations as cannibalism. He urges readers to reflect on the inherent contradictions in societal norms concerning human life and the treatment of the dead versus the living, challenging the reader to reconsider what constitutes true barbarity. Through a series of anecdotes and philosophical arguments, Voltaire critiques the moral frameworks surrounding humanity's darkest impulses and their historical context.
