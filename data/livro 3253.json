    "resumo": "\"The Homing Pigeon\" by the United States Army Signal Corps is a military technical manual written in the early 1940s. The book serves as a comprehensive guide on the breeding, care, and training of homing pigeons, particularly for military use during World War II. It likely covers topics relevant to their deployment as message carriers in wartime scenarios, emphasizing their utility as reliable communication tools.

It delves into their natural instincts, highlighting their ability to return to their home lofts when released. The text emphasizes the importance of proper care, training regimes, and environmental conditions that influence the effectiveness of these birds as critical assets in military communications. Additionally, the manual outlines procedures for managing lofts, selecting pigeons, and maintaining their health, which is essential for successful operations in the field.
