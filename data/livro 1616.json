The play blends elements of comedy and tragedy, focusing on the life of the titular character, Adrienne Lecouvreur, a celebrated actress of the French stage during the early 18th century. Through this narrative, the story delves into her passionate and tumultuous love affair with Maurice de Saxe and the rivalries she faces, particularly with the jealous Duchesse de Bouillon.  The opening of \"Adrienne Lecouvreur\" establishes the setting of an elegant boudoir in the home of the Princesse de Bouillon, hinting at the social complexity of the characters involved. The dialogue introduces key figures such as the Abbé, the princess herself, and hints at the intense rivalry between the actress Adrienne Lecouvreur and her competitor, Mlle. Duclos. A sense of intrigue builds around the relationships and tensions, particularly as characters discuss the anticipated performance where Adrienne and Duclos will perform together, setting the stage for themes of jealousy, ambition, and the quest for recognition in the world of theater.
