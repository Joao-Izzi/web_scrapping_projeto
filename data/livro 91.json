    "resumo": "\"The Sea Fairies\" by L. Frank Baum is a children's fantasy novel written in the early 20th century. The book introduces readers to a magical underwater world inhabited by mermaids and other sea creatures, focusing on the adventures of a little girl named Trot and her friend, Cap'n Bill. This enchanting tale promises an exploration of a hidden oceanic kingdom and the whimsical personalities that dwell within it.  At the start of the story, we meet Trot, a spirited young girl, and her companion, the old sailor Cap'n Bill, as they enjoy a sunny day by the Pacific Ocean. They engage in a lively conversation about mermaids, with Cap'n Bill sharing superstitiously fearful tales about them. Trot's curiosity leads her to wish for a glimpse of a mermaid, which promptly comes true when she and Cap'n Bill encounter enchanting mermaid princesses while boating. The opening section sets the stage for their journey into the depths of the sea, where they are invited to explore the underwater kingdom and meet various delightful sea fairies.
