    "resumo": "\"Annie Laurie and Azalea\" by Elia Wilkinson Peattie is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story focuses on the lives of two young girls, Azalea and Annie Laurie, who come from contrasting backgrounds and must navigate the complexities of friendship and identity in a small community. The narrative explores themes of belonging, familyâ€”and the challenges posed by new relationships.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Azalea McBirney, a girl raised by the McBirney family in the mountains, and her affectionate bond with her foster brother Jim. As they prepare for school, a sense of urgency fills the atmosphere. The story shifts to Annie Laurie Pace, who is getting ready for church and reveals that she feels out of place as she transitions to a new school with prestigious classmates. Her arrival at the school is marked by uncertainty as she grapples with the cold reception from her peers, Azalea and Carin. The opening chapters set the stage for the emotional developments and conflicts that will arise as both girls confront their pasts and forge a new friendship amidst the challenges they face together.
