    "resumo": "\"Adolphe: Erään tuntemattoman papereista löydetty tarina\" by Benjamin Constant is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story explores the complex emotional landscape of the protagonist, Adolphe, as he navigates his relationships and societal expectations, particularly focusing on his tumultuous connection with Ellénore, a character reflecting the dualities present in Constant's own life.   At the start of the narrative, we meet Adolphe, who, at 22 years of age, reflects on his upbringing and his father's aspirations for him. Despite achieving success academically, he feels disconnected from his father and struggles with feelings of shyness and isolation. Adolphe's sense of detachment deepens as he encounters a young woman's genuine affection for another man, stirring feelings of inadequacy within him and kindling a desire for love and connection. As the opening unfolds, we witness Adolphe's inner turmoil and introspection against the backdrop of his interactions with Ellénore, setting the stage for the intricate emotional dynamics that will define their relationship.
