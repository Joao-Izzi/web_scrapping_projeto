    "resumo": "\"A Study of Some Factors Influencing Fertility and Sterility in the Bull\" by Herbert Lester Gilman is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the reproductive health of bulls, examining various physiological and pathological factors that may affect their fertility and sterility. The book is particularly relevant to veterinarians and breeders, as it highlights the crucial role of the bull in not only reproducing healthy offspring but also in potentially transmitting infections that can compromise the reproductive efficiency of cattle herds.  The opening of the thesis outlines the significance of normal reproduction to the cattle industry and stresses how the male's role has often been overlooked. Gilman articulates a comprehensive purpose for the study, which includes summarizing existing knowledge on male genital anatomy and physiology, investigating the pathology and bacteriology of the bull's genital tract, and exploring the bull's potential as a disseminator of infections affecting female cows. Key initial observations point to various factors influencing fertility, underscoring a need for more thorough investigations into this complex and essential aspect of veterinary science.
