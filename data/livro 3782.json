    "resumo": "\"The Educated Negro and His Mission\" by W. S. Scarborough is a scholarly essay published in the early 20th century, specifically in 1903. This work addresses the dynamic and evolving discourse surrounding the education of African Americans during a time when the United States grappled with issues of race, opportunity, and social mobility. The book likely explores the essential role and mission of educated Black individuals in the broader context of their community and society.  In the essay, Scarborough emphasizes that the educated Negro has a crucial mission: to uplift their race through knowledge, leadership, and service. He articulates the need for higher education and advocates for a balanced approach to both industrial and scholarly training, arguing that true progress for the Black community demands a foundation in both practical skills and academic achievement. Scarborough points out the dangers of confining education to vocational training alone and insists that the furthering of Negro scholarship is vital for the well-being and advancement of the race. He describes how educated individuals can inspire and lead their communities, tackle moral and social issues, and contribute to political and civic engagement, underscoring the significant impact that an educated class can have on the future of African Americans.
