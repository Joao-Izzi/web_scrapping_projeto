    "resumo": "\"Villipeto\" by Jack London is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Sam Stubener, a boxing impresario, who discovers the son of a former boxing legend, Pat Glendon, and is drawn into the world of boxing. The narrative starts with Sam receiving a mysterious letter that rekindles his interest in the sport, leading him to meet the enigmatic and prodigious young fighter, Pat Glendon.  The opening portion of the book introduces Sam Stubener as he reviews a slew of letters, signaling his busy life as an impresario in the boxing circuit. His attention is caught by a letter from the aging Pat Glendon, who claims to have trained his son, also named Pat, to be a natural-born boxer with extraordinary skills. Intrigued, Stubener decides to investigate further, and the story unfolds as Sam travels to find the younger Pat. The initial chapters set the stage for exploration into the dynamics of boxing, the father-son relationship, and the challenges of adapting to both the sport and the expectations that come with it. Through vivid descriptions of old boxing lore and the charactersâ€™ motivations, London weaves a tale that hints at both the glory and pitfalls of prize fighting.
