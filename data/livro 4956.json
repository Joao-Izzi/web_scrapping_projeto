    "resumo": "\"In Freedom's Cause: A Story of Wallace and Bruce\" by G. A. Henty is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The book focuses on the legendary figures William Wallace and Robert the Bruce as they lead Scotland in its struggle for independence from English rule. It captures the tumultuous events surrounding Scotland's fight for freedom as seen through the eyes of young Archie Forbes, who emerges as an emblematic character of hope and valor in this fight.  The opening of the narrative establishes the backdrop in the village of Glen Cairn, setting a scene filled with tension as the characters navigate life under the oppressive authority of the Kerrs, their historical enemies. Young Archie, the son of the slain Sir William Forbes, is deeply affected by his father's death and is determined to reclaim his heritage and contribute to Scotland's liberation. As the story unfolds, we see him practice with weapons, learn about Scotland's political struggles, and begin to form a band of young men eager to join Wallace's cause. Archie's excitement is palpable as he hears tales of Wallace’s exploits, and the narrative foreshadows his own journey towards heroism and commitment to Scotland’s freedom.
