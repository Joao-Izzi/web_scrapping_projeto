    "resumo": "\"The Lady in the Car\" by William Le Queux is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the intriguing adventures of Prince Albert of Hesse-Holstein as he navigates the complexities of royal life, romance, and clandestine escapades while mingling with captivating women, particularly those from America and Britain. Le Queux dives into themes of social status, identity, and the tension between public persona and private desire.  The opening of the book introduces us to the Prince in a luxurious Brighton hotel, where he enjoys a quiet moment of reflection after having dismissed an unwanted visitor. He is distinctly aware of the attention he attracts from other hotel guests, particularly the well-to-do American mother-daughter duo, Mrs. Jesup and Mary. The Princeâ€™s curiosity about Mary leads to a charming invitation for a motor outing together, which serves to highlight their budding connection. Meanwhile, we see hints of intrigue and past adventures involving shadowy characters, setting the stage for a narrative filled with romance and potential mischief, as the Prince's past and present intertwine in surprising ways.
