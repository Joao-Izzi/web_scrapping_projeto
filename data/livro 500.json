    "resumo": "\"Finger Prints\" by Francis Galton is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This book explores the anatomical and biological significance of finger ridges, which are distinct patterns found on the palms and soles, and discusses their utility for personal identification. Galton aims to illustrate how these unique patterns provide an incredibly reliable means of recognizing individuals, addressing broader implications related to heredity and biological diversity.  The opening of the book introduces the concept of papillary ridges on fingers and emphasizes their importance and permanence in human identity. Galton contrasts these with skin creases, which lack significance for identification. He recounts his personal journey into studying fingerprints, sparked by the need to understand their potential for anthropometric identification. The introduction also outlines the subsequent chapters of the book, which will delve into previous uses of fingerprints, methods for acquiring clear prints, the biological characteristics of these patterns, and their implications in forensic science. Overall, this section sets the stage for a detailed scientific inquiry into a topic that has both practical applications and philosophical inquiries into human identity.
