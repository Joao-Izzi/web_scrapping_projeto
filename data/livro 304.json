    "resumo": "\"The Unhallowed Harvest\" by Homer Greene is a social commentary novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the Reverend Robert Bruce Farrar, who finds himself embroiled in a court case involving a working-class family, the Bradleys, after the husband suffers a life-altering injury at work. Through the lens of this legal struggle, the narrative explores themes of social justice, inequality, and the human condition.  At the start of the novel, the Reverend Farrar attends a courtroom trial where a negligence case is being decided against the Malleson Manufacturing Company. He is particularly interested in the case due to the human elements involved, namely the struggles of the injured worker, John Bradley, and the emotional turmoil faced by his wife, Mary. As the court proceedings unfold, it becomes clear that while the law is being upheld, a greater moral injustice may be at play, as the ruling favors the corporation despite its negligence. Mary Bradley’s fierce determination to fight for her husband’s dignity and their family's rights highlights the stark divide between the wealthy and the working class, setting the stage for further developments in their lives and in the socio-economic landscape of the time.
