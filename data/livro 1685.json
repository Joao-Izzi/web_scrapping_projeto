    "resumo": "\"Two Little Waifs\" by Mrs. Molesworth is a children's novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows two young siblings, Gladys and Roger, who are on the brink of a significant transition as they prepare to reunite with their father after years of being cared for by others, including the kindly Mrs. Lacy. The narrative captures their imaginative play and the bittersweet emotions that arise from leaving behind their familiar lives for the unknown.  At the start of the narrative, Gladys and Roger engage in a charming game where they pretend to journey \"over the sea\" to their father. This playful innocence is contrasted with the underlying sadness of their situation; their mother is a distant memory to them, and they're aware that Mrs. Lacy, who has cared for them, may soon not be in their lives. When they learn that their father has sent for them to join him, a mix of joy and anxiety unfolds as they prepare for the move, coupled with Mrs. Lacyâ€™s tender worries about their departure. The opening chapters effectively introduce the themes of familial love, longing, and the challenges of change faced by children, setting the stage for their adventure to come.
