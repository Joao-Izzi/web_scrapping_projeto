    "resumo": "\"The Great Round World and What Is Going On In It, Vol. 1, No. 47, September 30, 1897\" is a historical publication authored by an unnamed collective, likely linked to G.H. Rosenfeld, that presents news and commentary on global events during the late 19th century. This periodical, issued during a time of significant geopolitical tensions and social change, covers various topics including international relations, military conflicts, and societal developments. The primary theme revolves around the contemporary events affecting different regions of the world, particularly focusing on the political landscape and military struggles.  The publication details several key events from that era, including a Royal Commission announced by the Sultan of Turkey regarding Armenian welfare, critical updates on the Cuban War of Independence where insurgent forces, under General Calixto Garcia, achieved a notable victory at the town of Victoria de las Tunas, and developments in the British colonial landscape involving tribes in India. The piece also considers the political situation in Hawaii concerning the annexation treaty and innovations such as a new bullet-proof cloth invented by a Chicago priest. Overall, it serves as a snapshot of dynamic global affairs, reflecting the complex interplay of nationalism, colonialism, and technological advancements at the close of the 19th century.
