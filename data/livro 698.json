    "resumo": "\"Tarzan ja valkoinen nainen\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the famed character Tarzan, the lord of the jungle, as he navigates personal dilemmas and dangers surrounding his relationships, particularly with Bertha Kircher, a white woman. As the narrative unfolds, themes of love, survival, and conflict with wild and human adversaries emerge.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to a tense situation where Bertha Kircher and a young English officer, Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick, find themselves at the mercy of Usanga, a native with ambitions of controlling an aircraft and the white woman. The opening builds suspense as Bertha expresses her fears while the Lieutenant tries to negotiate their escape by teaching Usanga to fly the plane. The stakes rise when Usanga captures Bertha and attempts to transport her away, leading to desperate attempts for rescue. As Tarzan enters the narrative, he grapples with his complex feelings about humanity and his natural instincts, setting the stage for both physical and emotional confrontations that will unravel throughout the story.
