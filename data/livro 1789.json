    "resumo": "\"With Spurs of Gold: Heroes of Chivalry and Their Deeds\" by Frances Nimmo Greene and Dolly Williams Kirk is a collection of historical sketches written in the early 20th century. The work aims to captivate young readers with romanticized yet informative stories about legendary knights, such as Roland, the Cid, Godfrey, and Richard Coeur-de-Lion, emphasizing their valiant deeds and the ideals of chivalry that defined their eras. This engaging approach serves to enliven history by providing vivid and memorable narratives that might otherwise be lost within textbooks.  At the start of the book, the authors explain their intention to revive interest in historical figures celebrated for their chivalry. They express a commitment to portraying these heroes in a sympathetic light while balancing the ideals of the Middle Ages against modern sensibilities. The opening portion sets the stage for tales of significant characters from history, including the introduction of Charlemagne and the legendary figures Roland and Oliver. The narrative highlights Roland's early adventures, his friendship with Oliver, and the challenges they face, foreshadowing the conflicts that will arise as they navigate the treacherous world of chivalric valor and warfare.
