    "resumo": "\"Engines of the Gods\" by Gardner F. Fox is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around Kortha, a powerful Martian smith who grapples with his fears and the consequences of his past, embroiled in a conflict for control over a mysterious weapon that could change the balance of power in the universe. As the narrative unfolds, themes of power, self-discovery, and the haunting allure of love are interwoven with the rich tapestry of Martian lore and culture.  The opening of the book introduces the formidable character Kortha, who feels both overwhelmed by his strength and trapped by his own cowardice stemming from past violent actions. Living in isolation on Mars, he is approached by Ilse, a woman representing the Confederacy who implores him to return to leadership in order to save their planet from the aspiring tyrant Guantra. As Kortha grapples with his tortured conscience, he suddenly finds himself on a quest to uncover secrets from the ancient city of Yassa, potentially containing the powerful technology that Guantra seeks. This beginning establishes both the immediate stakes and the character dynamics that will drive the rest of the novel forward, making it a rich and engaging read for fans of space opera and heroic fantasy.
