    "resumo": "\"Cyrano de Bergerac\" by Edmond Rostand is a heroic comedy written during the late 19th century. The play introduces the larger-than-life character Cyrano, known for his exceptional wit, poetic prowess, and a notably large nose which he feels makes him unworthy of love, despite his deep affections for the beautiful Roxane. The story unfolds against a backdrop of romance, dueling honor, and unrequited love, raising themes of inner beauty versus outward appearance.  At the start of the play, the audience is drawn into a bustling Parisian theater around the year 1640, where various characters prepare for a performance. As patrons arrive, Cyrano's presence is anticipated with excitement. His reputation precedes him, hinted at through the banter of other characters who discuss his unusual nose and his disdain for a rival actor, Montfleury. The stage is set for his dramatic entrance, showcasing his bold and humorous personality. Roxane is also introduced as an object of Cyrano's affections, alongside Christian, a young cadet who is in love with her and seeks Cyrano's help in wooing her. This initial setup presents a lively atmosphere filled with comedic exchanges and undercurrents of tension that promise to escalate in the ensuing acts.
