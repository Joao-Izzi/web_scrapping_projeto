    "resumo": "\"The Engineer\" by Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth is a science fiction novella that was likely written in the mid-20th century, during a period marked by post-war optimism in technology and exploration. The story revolves around the challenges faced by engineers working in deep-sea oil drilling, highlighting the technical and ethical dilemmas inherent in resource extraction.   The narrative focuses on the character Muhlenhoff, who is managing an oil drilling project under the ocean. As technical problems arise regarding leaks and structural integrity, he struggles with the panic among his team and works to maintain order while realizing he is more of a figurehead than an actual problem solver. As he reflects on his career and the importance of perception in leadership, the story unveils themes of corporate greed, human error, and the clashing of ideals against the harsh realities of technological endeavors. The climax occurs when Muhlenhoff is confronted with the reality of the failing systems, challenging his previous notions of control and competence in a high-pressure environment.
