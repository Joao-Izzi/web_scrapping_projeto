    "resumo": "\"Haydn\" by J. Cuthbert Hadden is a biographical account written in the early 20th century that delves into the life and musical career of composer Joseph Haydn. The book covers Haydn's humble beginnings, his rise to prominence, and his lasting impact on classical music, notably as the \"father of the symphony\" and the sonata. Through exploring his personal and professional challenges, Hadden presents a comprehensive picture of Haydn's character and contributions to music history.  At the start of the biography, the author introduces Haydn's early life in Rohrau, Austria, where he was born into a poor but nurturing family. The narrative outlines his musical precocity, supported by informal music-making sessions with his family, and his subsequent movement to Vienna to pursue a formal education in music, which was marked by hardship. The opening chapters detail encounters with various mentors and experiences that shaped him, including rigorous training at St. Stephen's Cathedral and early compositions. It sets the stage for understanding how these formative experiences prepared Haydn for a long and successful career, which would evolve as he garnered recognition and respect within the musical community.
