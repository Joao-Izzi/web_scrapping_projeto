    "resumo": "\"Der Kollektivismus und die soziale Monarchie\" by Josef von Neupauer is a philosophical and socio-political treatise written in the early 20th century. The work discusses the principles of collectivism and the potential for a social monarchy to address contemporary socio-economic challenges. It delves into how the state can manage resources, labor distribution, and societal welfare, proposing a collective ownership model aimed at enhancing communal well-being.  The opening of the treatise introduces the author's arguments by referencing a speech from the Austrian Minister President, Baron Beck, suggesting the need to balance individual aspirations with the requirements of state governance. Neupauer emphasizes the necessity for Austria to transition into a collectivist state, underlining how the existing individualistic economic structure leads to social unrest. He outlines his vision for a new societal order where the state assumes ownership of resources, and all citizens contribute labor towards common goals, setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of the collectivist principles that he intends to unfold throughout the work.
