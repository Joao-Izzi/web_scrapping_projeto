    "resumo": "\"English Lands, Letters and Kings, vol. 2: From Elizabeth to Anne\" by Donald G. Mitchell is a historical account written during the late 19th century. This volume serves as a cultural exploration of England during the transition from Queen Elizabeth I to Queen Anne, emphasizing the interplay between literature and the significant historical figures of that era. The narrative likely delves into the lives, characters, and contributions of key individuals, such as King James I and Sir Walter Raleigh, while highlighting the evolution of English society and its literary landscape.  The opening of the work introduces the political and cultural environment of early 17th century England, immediately following the death of Elizabeth I. It discusses the arrival of King James I from Scotland and outlines significant literary figures who flourished during this time, including Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. The text reflects on the transitions within the royal lineage, the burgeoning of London as a significant cultural hub, and the challenges facing notable figures like Raleigh, who are caught up in the political intrigues of the period. As such, the beginning of the book sets a rich historical context, promising readers a vivid portrayal of the interplay between England's lands, its literary achievements, and the prominent monarchs that shaped its course.
