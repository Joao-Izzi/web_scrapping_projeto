    "resumo": "\"A Strange World: A Novel. Volume 2 (of 3)\" by M. E. Braddon is a fictional narrative likely written in the late 19th century. This volume continues to explore themes of love, loss, and social dynamics within a rural English setting, primarily focusing on the character Maurice Clissold and his interactions with the citizens of Penwyn Manor and surrounding areas. As Maurice navigates the complexities of his relationships and the impacts of past tragedies, readers are drawn into the emotional depth and intricate characterizations that define Braddon's work.  The opening of \"A Strange World\" presents us with Maurice Clissold as he reflects on his recent journey to Penwyn Manor. He interacts with the old housekeeper, Mrs. Darvis, who recounts the tragic history of the Penwyn family, particularly focusing on the late Mr. George Penwyn, who was highly esteemed. After the housekeeper departs, Maurice attempts to find lodging and encounters Elspeth, a wild, curious girl who offers to guide him. Their journey through the picturesque yet somber landscape leads Maurice to Trevanard's farm, where he is reluctantly offered shelter by Mrs. Trevanard, a stern yet complex woman. As the narrative unfolds, hints of deeper family secrets and the haunting presence of Muriel Trevanard, who appears to be struggling with mental anguish over a lost love, suggest that the tranquil setting is shadowed by unspoken sorrow and the weight of past decisions.
