    "resumo": "\"Battle of the Monkey & the Crab\" by Anonymous is a Japanese fairy tale likely written in the late 19th century. This book falls into the category of folklore and children's literature, presenting themes of justice and revenge through a fantastical narrative. The story features anthropomorphic characters, with a focus on the battle between a crafty monkey and a determined crab, ultimately serving as a cautionary tale about trust and integrity.  In the tale, a monkey tricks a crab into trading a piece of toasted rice-cake for a persimmon seed, which the crab plants and grows into a tall tree. However, when the monkey climbs the tree to eat the ripe persimmons and carelessly throws unripe ones at the crab, the crab gets injured. Enraged, the crab's family seeks revenge, enlisting the help of various creatures to devise a plot against the monkey. After luring the monkey into their lair under the pretense of peace, they successfully execute their plan, leading to the monkey's downfall. This tale highlights the consequences of deceit and the ability of the wronged to unite and seek retribution. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
