    "resumo": "\"The Ranch of the Tombstones\" by W. C. Tuttle is a complete novelette written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around two cowboys, Hashknife Hartley and Sleepy Stevens, who are in search of work and end up tangled in a mix of intrigue surrounding a mysterious graveyard and a series of murders.

The opening portion introduces Hashknife and Sleepy as they ride to the Half-Moon Ranch, where they meet Mrs. Snow, the ranch's proprietor.
