    "resumo": "\"Hawaiian Legends of Volcanoes\" by W. D. Westervelt is a collection of mythology written in the early 20th century. This work compiles various ancient tales of Hawaiian deities, particularly focusing on Pele, the goddess of fire, and her interactions with other divine figures, as well as the geological wonders of volcanic activity in the Hawaiian Islands. The legends intertwine natural phenomena with cultural beliefs, presenting a fascinating insight into Hawaiian mythology and the significance of volcanoes in their lore.  At the start of the text, the author introduces the reader to the profound connection between Hawaiian legends and the natural world, specifically volcanoes. The foreword outlines geological theories of the formation of the Hawaiian Islands, setting the stage for the myths that follow. The introduction further elaborates on the significance of volcanic eruptions in Hawaiian culture and introduces Pele's story, beginning with her search for a permanent home, including mentions of her rival Ai-laau, the forest eater, who represents destruction but is also a catalyst for creation. This opening portion establishes a narrative that blends mythology with geological facts, inviting readers into a world where gods influence the land's transformation.
