    "resumo": "\"Patents and How to Get One: A Practical Handbook\" by the U.S. Department of Commerce is a practical handbook written in the late 20th century. The book serves as a guide for inventors and prospective patent applicants, providing essential information on the patenting process and the functions of the Patent and Trademark Office. It aims to equip readers with a general understanding of patents, their legal implications, and steps involved in obtaining them.  The opening of the handbook outlines the purpose of the booklet, which is to deliver general information about patents and the operations of the Patent and Trademark Office, rather than serving as a comprehensive legal textbook. It explains the distinction between patents, copyrights, and trademarks and details the basic requirements for obtaining a patent, including the novelty and usability of an invention. The text establishes the framework of patent laws and the functions of the Patent Office, setting the stage for further sections that delve into various technicalities related to the patent application process.
