    "resumo": "\"The Work Of Christ: Past, Present and Future\" by Arno Clemens Gaebelein is a theological exploration written in the early 20th century. This book serves as a comprehensive examination of the work of Jesus Christ, focusing on three key aspects: His past work (primarily His incarnation and crucifixion), His present work (including His role as mediator and intercessor), and His future work (involving His promised return and reign). Gaebelein’s work is aimed at providing a clear understanding of Christ's multifaceted role for the church and humanity.  In this work, Gaebelein meticulously outlines the significance of each aspect of Christ’s work, beginning with His past accomplishments and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah. He emphasizes the importance of the crucifixion as the pivotal moment in salvation history, articulating how it relates to the believer’s present experience. The author then transitions to discuss Christ’s ongoing role in heaven as our High Priest and Advocate, highlighting how this affects the believer's life and relationship with God. Finally, Gaebelein anticipates the future fulfillment of Christ’s kingship and the establishment of His eternal kingdom, portraying a vision of hope and restoration for creation. Overall, the book weaves a compelling narrative that underscores the centrality of Christ in the believer's faith journey and the importance of understanding His work in all three dimensions.
