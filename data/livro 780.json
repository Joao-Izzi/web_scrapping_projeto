    "resumo": "\"The Heart's Kingdom\" by Maria Thompson Daviess is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Charlotte Powers, a strong-willed woman struggling with her identity and societal expectations. As Charlotte navigates her relationships, particularly with Nickols Powers and the Reverend Gregory Goodloe, the narrative delves into themes of love, religion, and the tensions of personal freedom versus social obligation.  At the start of the novel, Charlotte returns home from a winter spent in New York, filled with inner turmoil. She is confronted by her father, who has constructed a chapel in her garden, representing an intrusion of religious sentiment into her life. Through her spirited dialogues, particularly with Nickols, who desires a romantic relationship with her, and the enigmatic Goodloe, Charlotte grapples with her fear of religion and an awakening sense of self. The chapter sets the stage for her complex relationships and foreshadows an evolving struggle between modernity and tradition as she engages with the men who challenge her views and beliefs.
