    "resumo": "\"The General Historie of Virginia, New England & the Summer Isles (Vol. I)\" by John Smith is a historical account written in the early 17th century. This work provides a detailed narrative of Smith's voyages and experiences in establishing early English colonies, particularly focusing on Virginia, New England, and the surrounding islands. Smith’s firsthand accounts include interactions with Indigenous peoples, the struggles of settlers, and the natural environment of the New World.  At the start of this historical account, the author presents an introduction where he outlines the motivations for the exploration and the establishment of colonies in the Americas. He establishes his credibility by referencing his own experiences as both an explorer and a leader in the colony. The opening pages tease a comprehensive overview of various expeditions leading up to Virginia’s colonization, emphasizing the roles of notable figures like Sir Walter Raleigh and detailing initial encounters with Indigenous peoples, including the notable offering of gifts, agricultural practices, and trade. The narrative sets the stage for a vibrant and tumultuous exploration filled with promise, peril, and the complex dynamics of colonialism in the New World.
