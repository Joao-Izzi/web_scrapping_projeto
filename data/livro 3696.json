The opening of this adaptation introduces Christian as a man distressed by a heavy burden of sin. He encounters Evangelist, who guides him toward the Wicket Gate, the entry point to salvation. Despite obstacles such as the Slough of Despond and the taunts of friends wishing him to return, Christian is determined to pursue his quest for deliverance.
