    "resumo": "\"Tales of Our Coast\" by S. R. Crockett et al. is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The anthology features a series of narratives that explore themes of smuggling, adventure, and the complexities of coastal life, anchored in richly drawn characters and settings. Each tale reflects the nuances of human nature against the backdrop of the sea, often highlighting interactions between characters from different walks of life.  The opening of \"Tales of Our Coast\" introduces the first story, \"The Smugglers of the Clone,\" where we meet young Robin of Airyolan, who is summoned at dawn to join a smuggling operation. This is a rite of passage for him, transitioning from boyhood to manhood as he prepares to assist in a daring run with the free-traders. His mother’s prayers and father’s advice echo in his mind as he dons his gear and rides to the beach, where he encounters both spirited camaraderie and potential conflict with rival groups. The story sets the stage for Robin’s character—a blend of youthful bravado and a sense of responsibility—while painting a vibrant picture of the coastal community and its illicit undertakings.
