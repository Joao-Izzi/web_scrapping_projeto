    "resumo": "\"Logic as the Science of the Pure Concept\" by Benedetto Croce is a philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century. This work is part of a series titled \"Philosophy of the Spirit,\" and aims to present an advanced understanding of logic and its inherent principles. The primary focus of the book is an in-depth examination of the nature of concepts, distinguishing between pure concepts and various forms of pseudoconcepts.  At the start of the text, the author introduces fundamental presuppositions related to logical activity, highlighting key distinctions between thought, representations, intuitions, and language. Croce emphasizes that true logical knowledge transcends mere representation, setting the stage for the exploration of the pure concept as a necessary cognitive form. He critiques formal logic and presents a new framework that rejects outdated and simplistic views, thus proposing a foundation for understanding thought and knowledge as intertwined aspects of the human spirit.
