    "resumo": "\"A Book of Golden Deeds\" by Charlotte M. Yonge is a collection of narratives focused on selfless acts of heroism, likely written in the mid-19th century. This compilation aims to inspire young readers by recounting various instances of courageous and noble deeds across history, celebrating the spirit of self-devotion and morality. Its themes resonate with altruism, emphasizing actions taken for the greater good rather than for personal gain.  The opening of the book provides a preface that sets the tone for the collection, describing the intention behind the narratives. Yonge introduces the idea of a \"Golden Deed,\" distinguishing it from mere acts of bravery motivated by selfishness or ambition. She discusses the concept of self-devotion and illustrates various historical references, noting that these deeds are often overshadowed by the more sensational stories of warfare and conquest. Yonge seeks to elevate these accounts of virtue and integrity, positioning them as examples worth emulating for readers, thereby nurturing their moral growth and understanding of heroism.
