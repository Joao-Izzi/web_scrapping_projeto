    "resumo": "\"The Diamond Cross Mystery\" by Chester K. Steele is a detective novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds around the murder of Mrs. Amelia Darcy, the owner of a jewelry store, and introduces James Darcy, her cousin and jeweler, as a central character who discovers her body. As the narrative progresses, a web of intrigue, suspicion, and details about the old lady's life and relationships begin to emerge, setting the stage for a classic whodunit scenario.  The opening of the novel establishes a dark and atmospheric scene within the jewelry shop, where the rain outside contrasts the shocking stillness of the murder scene. James Darcy wakes early to find Mrs. Darcy dead, holding a ticking watch in her hand, which immediately deepens the mystery. The narrative introduces other characters such as milkmen and nearby shop owners, all of whom provide background details that could tie them to the crime, while hints of a quarrel regarding money and family tensions hint at potential motives. With the arrival of police and detectives, as well as a cast of suspicious characters, the stage is set for unraveling the complexities surrounding the murder and the key players in the story.
