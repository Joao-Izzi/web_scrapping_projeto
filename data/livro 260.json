    "resumo": "\"The Faust-Legend and Goethe's 'Faust'\" by H. B. Cotterill is a scholarly analysis written in the early 20th century. This work explores the narrative and theological themes of the Faust legend, particularly focusing on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's interpretation of the story in his ambitious work, \"Faust.\" The book aims to shed light on the historical evolution of the Faust theme and Goethe's philosophical contributions to it.  The opening of the book sets the stage by addressing the complexity of the Faust legend and the challenges faced by readers and commentators in understanding it. H. B. Cotterill reflects on Goethe's philosophy, emphasizing the poet's rejection of strict analysis in favor of embracing the living essence of his works. He discusses Goethe's approach to capturing the profound human desires and dilemmas represented in the Faust narrative. The text hints at an illumination of the character of Faust, portraying him as a figure searching for deeper meaning in life beyond mere scholarly pursuits, and raises the concept that such quests can lead to both enlightenment and peril.
