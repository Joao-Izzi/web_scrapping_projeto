    "resumo": "\"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group\" by William E. Duellman and M.J. Fouquette, Jr. is a scientific publication written in the late 20th century. This work dives into the taxonomy, ecology, and evolutionary relationships of small yellow tree frogs found in southern Mexico and Central America, specifically those belonging to the Hyla microcephala group. The book presents extensive research findings, including details on species identification, mating calls, and life history.  The opening of this study establishes the authors' credentials and their collaborative efforts over eleven years to study the Hyla microcephala group in the field. It highlights the complexity and confusion in the classification of these frogs, initiated by prior researchers' lack of familiarity with the species and their variations. The introduction outlines the methodologies utilized in their research, including fieldwork, analysis of mating calls, and cranial osteology, setting the stage for a comprehensive examination of the species involved in this distinct ecological niche.
