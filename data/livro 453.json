    "resumo": "\"The Master-Girl\" by Ashton Hilliers is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Dêh-Yān, a young woman of the Little Moons tribe, who is strong, capable, and often burdened by the expectations of her gender in a primitive society. As she navigates the challenges of life, she finds herself drawn to a wounded enemy, Pŭl-Yūn, leading to a series of transformative events that challenge the conventions of her world.  The opening of the book introduces us to the characters Dêh-Yān and Pŭl-Yūn against the backdrop of their harsh, prehistoric environment. Dêh-Yān is initially in a position of authority over the younger girls in her tribe, revealing her competence in survival skills such as hunting and gathering. When she encounters Pŭl-Yūn, who is stranded and injured, she faces a choice between her tribal customs and her instincts. The narrative establishes a tense yet adventurous dynamic between the two characters, setting the stage for themes of gender roles, survival, and the confrontation of societal norms as their relationship develops amid the primal threat of the elements and predators.
