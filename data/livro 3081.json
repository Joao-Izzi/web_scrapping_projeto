    "resumo": "\"The Ethics of George Eliot's Works\" by John Crombie Brown is a critical essay written in the late 19th century. This work examines the ethical and moral lessons embedded in the writings of George Eliot, particularly highlighting her emphasis on self-sacrifice and theChristian principles that transcend societal norms. Brown positions Eliot as a significant moral teacher of her time, interpreting her characters and narratives as illustrations of profound ethical dilemmas that confront humanity.  The opening of the essay presents a preface outlining the author's reflections during the final stages of his life, ultimately motivated by a conversation about Eliot's works. Brown discusses the overarching philosophy in Eliot's writings, notably the distinction between individual happiness and a higher moral consciousness, as exemplified by her characters. He suggests that Eliot's stories serve as vehicles for conveying deeper truths about duty, love, sacrifice, and the implications of living for something greater than oneself, thus setting the stage for a thorough exploration of her literary legacy.
