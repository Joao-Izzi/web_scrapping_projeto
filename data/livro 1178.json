    "resumo": "\"Camp-fire and Wigwam\" by Edward Sylvester Ellis is a historical adventure novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around young Jack Carleton, who, along with his friend Otto Relstaub, embarks on a quest to retrieve a lost horse in the wilderness of Louisiana. Their journey leads them to encounter both the challenges of nature and the threat of Native American tribes, particularly the Shawanoes.  At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to the characters in their log cabin home in Martinsville, Missouri. Jack is portrayed as curious and courageous, reflecting on recent adventures and expressing admiration for the enigmatic Deerfoot, a young Shawanoe Indian who has previously saved his father's life. A sense of foreboding begins to creep in as both boys plan their expedition despite the mother's concerns. Their adventure takes a dangerous turn when they are captured by a group of Indians, leading to a gripping narrative of their efforts to escape, survive, and ultimately find their way home, intertwined with themes of friendship, bravery, and the complexities of their interactions with different cultures.
