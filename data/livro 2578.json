    "resumo": "\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a classic children's novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows a young boy named Cedric Errol, known as \"Ceddie,\" who discovers that he is the heir to an English earldom after the deaths of his father and uncles. The central theme revolves around Cedric's kindness and innocence as he navigates the complexities of aristocracy and the expectations placed upon him while remaining devoted to his loving mother.  The opening of the book introduces Cedric's world, a humble life in New York with his widowed mother, who has struggled after the loss of her husband. As Cedric learns about his lineage and the old-fashioned customs associated with being a lord, he grapples with the implications of his new title. His character shines through his genuine concern for his friends and less fortunate neighbors, such as Bridget and Michael. The first chapters set up the juxtaposition of his warm-hearted nature against the backdrop of aristocratic privilege, foreshadowing the challenges and joys he will experience as he embarks on this unexpected life journey.
