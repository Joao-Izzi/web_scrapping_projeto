    "resumo": "\"Latin Vulgate, Esther: Liber Esther\" by Anonymous is a religious scripture that details the narrative of the Book of Esther, likely written during the early centuries AD. This text is part of the Latin Vulgate, which is a significant Latin translation of the Bible. The likely topic of the book is the story of Queen Esther, a Jewish woman who rises to become queen of Persia and saves her people from annihilation through her bravery and intelligence.  The storyline follows Esther, who is chosen to be the queen of King Xerxes after the dismissal of Queen Vashti. When a royal official named Haman plots to exterminate the Jews, Esther's cousin Mordecai encourages her to reveal her identity to the king and plead for her people's safety. Despite the risk to her own life, Esther bravely approaches the king and eventually exposes Haman's deceit and malicious intent. The narrative culminates in a series of events that leads to the Jews defending themselves against their enemies, celebrating their survival with the festival of Purim, thus marking a significant turn from despair to joy through courage and divine intervention.
