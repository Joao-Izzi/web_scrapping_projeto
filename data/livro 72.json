    "resumo": "\"Araapilainen pulveri: Yksinäytöksinen huvinäytelmä\" by Ludvig Holberg is a comedic play likely written in the early 18th century. This one-act farce showcases themes of deception, ambition, and the folly of greed, as it follows characters who delve into the quixotic pursuit of turning base metals into gold through fraudulent means.  The storyline revolves primarily around Kettuliini, a con artist posing as a master alchemist, who convinces the gullible Polidor that he can teach him the secret art of gold-making. The play explores the interactions between Kettuliini, his accomplice Andreas, and Polidor, as well as various other characters who become embroiled in Kettuliini's schemes. As the plot unfolds, Kettuliini cleverly manipulates Polidor into believing in a fictitious \"araapialainen pulveri\" (Arabian powder) that supposedly holds the key to wealth. Ultimately, the comedic tension escalates as the truth of Kettuliini's trickery is revealed, culminating in a farcical exploration of human folly and the consequences of blind ambition.
