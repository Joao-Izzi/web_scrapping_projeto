    "resumo": "\"Hans Lange: Näytelmä viidessä näytöksessä\" by Paul Heyse is a dramatic play written in the late 19th century. The story is set in the backdrop of East Pommerania in 1476 and revolves around Duke Sophia, her son Bugslaff, and the court's intricate power dynamics. The main themes appear to explore familial loyalty, class struggles, and the tension between personal desires and societal expectations.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to Duchess Sophia, who is troubled by a letter from her husband calling for their son Bugslaff to join him in battle. This call demands a sacrifice from her, stirring feelings of anguish and reflection about her past choices. Evald von Massov, her loyal court marshal, counsels her, suggesting that marriage and reconciliation with her husband might be possible if Bugslaff goes to the duke. Amidst the unfolding drama, Hans Lange, a simple peasant, is introduced as a potential guardian for Bugslaff, which sets the stage for various character interactions and the complex interplay of class relations throughout the narrative.
