The author emphasizes the indigenous nature of these mythologies while exploring their rich tapestry of stories and beliefs that shaped the lives of their adherents. Throughout the text, Spence places a strong emphasis on the universality of myth and the importance of understanding these ancient cultures in the context of world history.
