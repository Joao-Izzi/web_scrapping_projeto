    "resumo": "\"Diccionario Ingles-Espa침ol-Tagalog\" by Sofronio G. Calder칩n is a bilingual dictionary written in the early 20th century. This reference work provides translations and definitions for English words in Spanish and Tagalog, making it a useful tool for language learners and translators interested in the linguistic connections between these languages.  The opening portion of the dictionary contains an extensive list of entries, beginning with the letter \"A.\" Each entry includes the English word, its parts of speech, phonetic pronunciation, and translations in both Spanish and Tagalog. For example, the word \"abandon\" is defined as \"abandonar\" in Spanish and \"magpabaya\" in Tagalog. This format continues throughout the text, emphasizing the importance of understanding not only direct translations but also the usage of words within different contexts across the three languages.
