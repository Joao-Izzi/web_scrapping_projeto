    "resumo": "\"Three in Norway\" by J. A. Lees and Walter J. Clutterbuck is a travel narrative written in the late 19th century. This book recounts the adventures of three men—the Skipper, Esau, and John—as they make their way through Norway in search of fishing, reindeer, and picturesque beauty. The narrative likely captures their experiences of the landscapes, local culture, and the challenges they face along their journey.  The opening of the book introduces the three main characters and sets up the premise of their trip to Norway, where they aim to fish and explore the wilderness. The Skipper, with experience at sea and a troubled demeanor, is the leader of the group; Esau is a jovial and hearty companion with a penchant for food; and John is the newcomer, a tall Irishman eager for adventure. The early chapters detail their preparations for the journey, their voyage to Norway aboard a ship, and their first experiences in the city of Christiania. They face humorous misadventures and logistical challenges, such as transporting their unusual baggage of canoes and camping gear, setting a lighthearted tone for their explorations ahead.
