    "resumo": "\"Was ihr wollt\" by William Shakespeare is a comedic play written during the late 16th century. The story revolves around themes of love, mistaken identities, and the complexities of human desire, featuring key characters such as Duke Orsino, who is infatuated with the mourning Olivia, and Viola, who disguises herself as a man named CÃ¦sario while navigating her own love for Orsino. The play employs classic Shakespearean elements of wit, humor, and romantic entanglements.  The opening portion of the play establishes a rich tapestry of emotions and relationships. Duke Orsino, melancholic over his unrequited love for Olivia, muses on the nature of desire, while his messenger, Viola, is secretly in love with him. Viola has just survived a shipwreck and is determined to find her twin brother, Sebastian, presumed dead. Meanwhile, Olivia is resolved to grieve for her late brother and avoid romantic entanglements, setting up a complex love triangle. As Viola disguises herself and becomes involved in courtly affairs, the stage is set for a whirlwind of misunderstandings and comedic situations that will unfold throughout the narrative.
