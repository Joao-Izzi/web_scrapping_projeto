    "resumo": "\"Zuñi Fetiches\" by Frank Hamilton Cushing is an ethnographic study written in the late 19th century. The book explores the religious beliefs and practices of the Zuñi people, specifically focusing on their worship of fetiches, or spirit objects, that embody the powers of nature and animals in their ecosystem. Cushing delves into the intricate relationships between the Zuñi's philosophy of life, their gods, and the nature of existence itself.  The opening of the book introduces the reader to Zuñi philosophy, which presents a worldview where all elements of nature, including humans, animals, and inanimate objects, are interconnected through a shared existence. It explains how the Zuñi people view animals as mediators between themselves and the divine, elaborating on the significance of fetiches in their rituals and spirituality. Cushing continues with a discussion on the origins of Zuñi fetichism, recounting foundational myths such as the \"Zuñi Iliad\" that illustrate the creation of the world and the interactions between gods and men, setting the stage for a deep exploration of the Zuñi's religious practices and beliefs throughout the text.
