    "resumo": "\"Siddhartha\" by Hermann Hesse is a philosophical novel written during the early 20th century. The story revolves around a young Indian Brahman named Siddhartha, who embarks on a spiritual journey in search of enlightenment and self-discovery amidst the complexities of life, including friendship, love, and the quest for true meaning beyond mere existence.  The opening portion of the book introduces Siddhartha as a gifted and intelligent son of a Brahman who is deeply loved by his family and friends, particularly his companion Govinda. Despite his privileged upbringing and the affection showered upon him, Siddhartha feels a profound emptiness within and begins to question traditional teachings and the spiritual practices prescribed by his father and the Brahmins. Discontented with a life focused solely on rituals and worship, he declares his intention to leave home and journey into asceticism with the Samanas, a group of wandering monks, suggesting the start of his quest for deeper truths about existence and the nature of the self.
