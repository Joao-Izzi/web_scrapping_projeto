    "resumo": "\"More Tales of the Ridings\" by F.W. Moorman is a collection of narrative tales written in the early 20th century. The book reflects the life and folklore of the Yorkshire Riding regions of England, weaving together local legends, fables, and poignant accounts of rural life. Through its various stories, readers are introduced to diverse characters, including the whimsical Melsh Dick and the resilient Mary Whittaker, showcasing both lighthearted and serious aspects of human experience against a backdrop of rich dialect and tradition.  The opening of the collection begins with the tale of Melsh Dick, a mystical woodland spirit linked to the folklore of the Pennines. This story introduces us to Doed, a young boy with a gammy leg who encounters Melsh Dick in the forest as he searches for hazel-nuts. Their meeting quickly turns surreal when Melsh Dick enchants Doed and leads him on a whimsical adventure, filled with squirrels and laughter until an unexpected turn of events results in Doed's fright and rescue. The second story shifts dramatically in tone with \"Two Letters,\" which paints a stark contrast as it introduces Annie, who receives a letter announcing the death of her husband in war, leading to deep emotional turmoil. This juxtaposition captures both the charm of local myths and the harsh realities faced by the community, setting a multifaceted tone for the tales to follow.
