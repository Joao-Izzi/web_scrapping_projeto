    "resumo": "\"An Address to a Wealthy Libertine\" by James Parkerson is a moralistic poem written in the early 19th century. This work serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of seduction and the impact of a libertine lifestyle on innocent victims, particularly focusing on the plight of a farmer's daughter led astray. The narrative reflects the societal values and concerns of its time, emphasizing the importance of virtue and the dangers of moral decay.  The poem consists of two primary sections: the address to the wealthy libertine and a letter from the unfortunate farmer's daughter to her parents. The author criticizes a man whose seduction has resulted in the ruin of a young woman, Stella, leading her to shame and despair. Through evocative language, the poem elucidates the emotional and social consequences of such actions, not only for the victims but also for the seducers, who find themselves marked by guilt and scorn. The heartfelt letter from Maria, the farmer's daughter, conveys her remorse and longing for redemption, revealing the internal struggles faced by women in a society that often condemns rather than forgives. Overall, the poem serves as a poignant reminder of the moral responsibilities individuals have toward one another. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
