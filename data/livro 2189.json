    "resumo": "\"With Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga\" by W. Bert Foster is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set against the backdrop of the pre-Revolutionary War period in the 18th century and follows the adventures of a young boy named Enoch Harding. The narrative focuses on his encounters and experiences with Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys as they navigate local turmoil involving land disputes, banditry, and conflicts with Yorkers.  The opening of the book introduces the reader to Enoch Harding, a thirteen-year-old boy skilled in hunting, who experiences a close call with a fierce catamount while pursuing a deer. His encounter is interrupted by an experienced ranger, Josiah Bolderwood, who saves him just in time, revealing Enochâ€™s deep desires to prove himself in a world rife with danger and uncertainty. As the two men prepare to join a gathering of settlers to defend against threats to their homes, Enoch feels the weight of responsibilities his family now carries, especially after the recent loss of his father. This sets the stage for the budding conflict over land and the lessons of valor and responsibility that Enoch will learn throughout the tale. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
