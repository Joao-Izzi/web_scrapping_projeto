    "resumo": "\"The Red Room\" by William Le Queux is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the mysterious and sudden murder of Professor Greer, a prominent chemist, and the implications that fall upon Kershaw Kirk, a peculiar man who has ties to the victim. The narrative unfolds through the eyes of Mr. Holford, a motor engineer, who finds himself caught in a whirlwind of intrigue as Kirk seeks assistance to unravel the complex web of secrets surrounding the crime.  At the start of the story, on January 15, 1907, Mr. Holford is approached by Kirk while working in his garage. Kirk requests to review a special German tyre in secrecy, hinting at a deeper connection to a serious issue. Their meeting lays the groundwork for a troubling friendship, as Kirk reveals his implications in a murder that takes place at the home of Professor Greer shortly after their discussion. Holford is soon drawn into a narrative filled with suspicion, hidden motives, and a series of curious events that escalate when the Professor's daughter is found dead under similarly mysterious circumstances, amplifying the tension in a tale where nothing is as it appears.
