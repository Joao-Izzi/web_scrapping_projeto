    "resumo": "\"Rakentaja Solness: Kolminäytöksinen murhenäytelmä\" by Henrik Ibsen is a three-act tragedy written in the late 19th century. The play delves into the life of the central character, Halvard Solness, a master builder facing the emotional and psychological struggles of his occupation and relationships. Themes of ambition, fear of youth, and the consequences of one’s actions are prominently featured throughout the narrative.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to various characters in Solness' modest office, including his assistants Knut and Ragnar Brovik, and the young clerk Kaija Fosli. The atmosphere is tense as Knut struggles with his failing health and expresses concern for his son Ragnar's future, especially regarding his ambition to build on his own. Solness enters, revealing his dismissive attitude towards outside clients and a desire to maintain control over his projects. Interpersonal dynamics unfold, showcasing Kaija's unrequited affections, Solness' complex feelings regarding youth, and the foreshadowing of how a visit from an unexpected character, Hilde Wangel, might disrupt the status quo of Solness’ life.
