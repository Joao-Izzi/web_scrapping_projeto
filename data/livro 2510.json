    "resumo": "\"The Fifth Wheel: A Novel\" by Olive Higgins Prouty is a fiction work written in the early 20th century. The story centers on Ruth Vars, a young woman navigating the social complexities and expectations of her upper-class New England community. As she makes her social debut and maneuvers through her relationships, particularly with the wealthy Breckenridge Sewall, Ruth confronts the challenges of balancing personal desires with societal ambitions.  At the start of the novel, Ruth is introduced as she walks alone in the countryside, reflecting on her life and the pressures of her debut. She describes her upbringing, the expectations placed upon her to succeed socially, and her complicated relationship with her sister-in-law, Edith. As Ruth prepares for her coming-out party, she grapples with feelings of ambition and the weight of familial expectations, all while hinting at her first encounter with Breck. This opening sets the tone for a story about self-discovery, societal influence, and the quest for personal meaning within the confines of social norms.
