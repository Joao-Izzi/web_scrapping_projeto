    "resumo": "\"The Snow-Image: A Childish Miracle and Other Twice-Told Tales\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a collection of short stories likely written in the mid-19th century. The stories explore themes of innocence, imagination, and the interplay between reality and fantasy, reflecting Hawthorne's Romantic style. The opening tale, \"The Snow-Image,\" introduces us to two enchanting children, Violet and Peony, who create a snow figure that they believe is a living playmate.  At the start of \"The Snow-Image,\" we meet the cozy domestic world of Violet and Peony as they venture out to play in the freshly fallen snow. Their mother's tender disposition contrasts with their father's practical nature, setting the stage for this whimsical tale. The children, fueled by their vivid imaginations, construct a snow-girl whom they envision as a sisterly companion. As their mother watches, she marvels at their innocent belief that this snow figure could come to life, leading to a series of delightful yet poignant events that culminate in a bittersweet reflection on childhood wonder and the harshness of adult realities. The tale captures how childlike belief can sometimes clash with the cold truths of the world, offering a gentle critique of practicality devoid of imagination.
