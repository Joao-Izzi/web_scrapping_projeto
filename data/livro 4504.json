    "resumo": "\"In the Footprints of Charles Lamb\" by Benjamin Ellis Martin is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work focuses on the life and times of the English writer and essayist Charles Lamb, tracing his path through the streets of London where he lived and worked, and examining both his unique character and his contributions to literature.   The opening of the book introduces readers to the authorâ€™s intent to create a topographical biography of Charles Lamb, highlighting Lamb's deep connection to London and its streets, and the historical locations associated with his life. Martin discusses how Lamb's homes have been preserved from destruction and describes the early environment of Lamb's youth, specifically his upbringing with his sister Mary in the Inner Temple. The text begins to explore the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they faced as a family, foreshadowing the themes of love, devotion, and the impact of mental health that will be examined throughout the book.
