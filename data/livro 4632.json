    "resumo": "\"Never Meet Again\" by Algis Budrys is a science fiction novella written during the mid-20th century, specifically around the time of the Cold War. The story focuses on themes of alternate realities and the consequences of choices made in different worlds, as it follows a scientist who has spent years working on a device that allows him to shift into a parallel universe. The narrative explores the philosophical implications of his work, particularly concerning lost opportunities and the nature of his existence.  The protagonist, Professor Jochim Kempfer, is an aging scientist who grapples with the memories of his deceased wife, Marthe, while reflecting on the years spent in a drab routine dominated by his painful past. After activating his invention, he unexpectedly finds himself in a grim version of Berlin where Germany lost World War II, bringing into question the choices and sacrifices made by him and his contemporaries. As he reunites with Marthe, who has lived through her struggles in this alternate existence, Kempfer confronts the stark reality of their lives, the changes brought by the different outcomes of the war, and the burden of his scientific responsibilities. Ultimately, he must decide how to navigate this new world while reconciling the shadows of his former life, leading to a haunting exploration of grief, identity, and the notion of \"what if.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
