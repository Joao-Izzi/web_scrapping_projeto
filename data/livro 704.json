    "resumo": "\"Montlivet\" by Alice Prescott Smith is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in the late 17th century, focusing on the character Armand de Montlivet, a French trader navigating the fraught relationships between colonial powers and Native tribes in North America. The book explores themes of conflict, identity, and survival against the backdrop of the lush yet dangerous wilderness, as Montlivet encounters various indigenous cultures and the complexities of their alliances with European settlers.  The opening of \"Montlivet\" introduces us to Armand de Montlivet as he walks along the beach in Michillimackinac, feeling buoyed by the promise of his upcoming beaver trapping venture. He soon crosses paths with La Mothe-Cadillac, the local commandant, and a conversation unfolds that hints at the tensions brewing between various factions, including French settlers, the Ottawas, and the fearing Iroquois. As the narrative progresses, indications of unrest and potential betrayal surface, especially regarding the fate of a captured Englishman, Benjamin Starling. This opening sets the stage for a tale filled with intrigue, personal rivalry, and the broader implications of colonialism, as characters grapple with their loyalties and the stakes of their uncertain futures.
