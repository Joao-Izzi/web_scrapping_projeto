    "resumo": "\"A kontárság kultusza\" by Émile Faguet is a critical sociopolitical treatise written in the early 20th century. The text addresses the prevalent ideologies influencing the political and social landscapes of modern democracies, especially focusing on the pitfalls of incompetence and demagoguery. Faguet critiques the excesses of democracy and the cultural shift towards incompetence that he observes in political institutions.  The opening of the book introduces Faguet's examination of political governance, positing that various forms of government, such as monarchy and democracy, each have foundational principles that can lead to their decline when overstretched or abandoned. He discusses the dangers associated with modern democracy, illustrating how it fosters a disregard for expertise and promotes an environment that prioritizes popular sentiment over competence. By drawing on historical references and contemporary examples, Faguet outlines his argument that the essence of democracy, while seemingly inclusive, can create a system where incompetence flourishes, ultimately threatening the integrity of governance itself.
