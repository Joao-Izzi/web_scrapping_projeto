    "resumo": "\"The Kādambarī of Bāṇa\" by Bāṇa and Bhūṣaṇabhaṭṭa is a classic prose romance composed during the 7th century, notable for its intricate storytelling and rich linguistic style. The narrative centers around the complex love story of King Çudraka, the noble Kadambari, and her beloved, weaving through themes of reincarnation, unfulfilled desire, and the interplay of fate. The work stands out as a foundational piece in Sanskrit literature, reflecting cultural and philosophical dimensions of its time.  The opening of \"Kādambarī\" introduces us to a world steeped in myth and legend, beginning with a learned parrot named Vaiçampayana, who is captured by a Candala maiden and presented to King Çudraka. Vaiçampayana recounts a profound story of love and sacrifice, emblematic of the tale's larger themes. It presents a narrative within a narrative, starting with the past lives of the characters, particularly the poignant tale of the king's reincarnated love, Kadambari. As the royal court anticipates stories of heroism and romance, the layers of interwoven destinies set the stage for a multifaceted exploration of love across lifetimes, capturing the attention of both characters and readers alike.
