    "resumo": "\"De complete werken van Joost van Vondel. De Amsteldamsche Hecuba\" by Vondel is a tragic play written in the early 17th century. The play centers around Hecuba, the last queen of Troy, as she grapples with unbearable loss, witnessing the downfall of her city, the murder of her husband, and the impending doom of her children. Through her lamentations, Vondel explores themes of grief, loss, and the futility of seeking revenge.  The opening of \"De Amsteldamsche Hecuba\" establishes a powerful atmosphere of despair and tragedy as Hecuba mourns the destruction of Troy and the slaughter of her family. She reflects on the devastation wrought by the Greeks, particularly the brutal execution of her daughter Polyxena and the death of her son Astyanax. Hecuba is surrounded by other Trojan women who share in her grief, collectively expressing their sorrow and despair. The scene is rich with vivid imagery and emotional intensity, setting the stage for a deeply resonant exploration of suffering and the human condition in the aftermath of war.
