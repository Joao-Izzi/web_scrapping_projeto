    "resumo": "\"Riita: Kertomus siitä, kuinka Ivan Ivanovitsh ja Ivan Nikiforovitsh riitaantuivat\" by N. V. Gogol is a novella written in the early 19th century. The work centers on two main characters, Ivan Ivanovitsh and Ivan Nikiforovitsh, who are depicted as good friends living in Mirgorod, but their relationship turns sour over a trivial disagreement. The story humorously explores the absurdity of human nature and the fragility of friendships.  At the start of the novella, we are introduced to Ivan Ivanovitsh, a kind-hearted man with a penchant for melons and a keen interest in his possessions and neighborhood. The detailed descriptions of his home, gardens, and interactions with another local, Ivan Nikiforovitsh, lay the groundwork for their eventual discord, which is sparked by a seemingly innocuous exchange. Gogol illustrates their contrasting personalities, with Ivan Ivanovitsh being talkative and amiable while Ivan Nikiforovitsh is more taciturn yet sharp-witted. Tensions escalate to a breaking point over a minor insult—calling someone a \"goose\"—leading to their public quarrel, despite their previous strong friendship, effectively setting the stage for the ensuing comedic drama.
