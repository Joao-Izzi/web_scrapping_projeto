    "resumo": "\"Children of Men\" by Bruno Lessing is a novel written in the early 20th century. It delves into the lives of immigrants in a bustling city, specifically focusing on the struggles of characters like Braun and Lizschen who navigate the harsh realities of work, health, and love amidst the backdrop of a sweatshop environment. The narrative likely explores themes of hope, desperation, and the indomitable spirit of those seeking respite from their burdens through art and connection.  The opening of this narrative introduces us to Braun, a determined worker in a noisy sewing shop, whoâ€™s grappling with the impending loss of Lizschen, his frail companion. The noise of the machines symbolizes the monotony of their lives and the emotional struggles they face daily. Braun is drawn into thoughts of escape and hope when he hears about an art exhibition nearby, believing it could provide a moment of beauty and joy for Lizschen. However, the harsh realities of their existence become starkly clear when they encounter resistance at the exhibition, and the fragile moments of happiness are fleeting and overshadowed by tragedy. This sets the stage for a story steeped in poignant human experiences, reflective of societal challenges. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
