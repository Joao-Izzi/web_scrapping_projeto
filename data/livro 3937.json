    "resumo": "\"At the Sign of the Sword: A Story of Love and War in Belgium\" by William Le Queux is a historical novel written in the early 20th century.\" Set against the backdrop of Belgium during the onset of World War I, the story unfolds amidst the tensions between personal romance and national conflict. The primary characters, Edmond Valentin and Aimee de Neuville, navigate their clandestine love while facing the looming threat of German invasion, with societal pressures and family expectations complicating their relationship.  \"The opening of the book introduces us to a serene summer day in Belgium before the storm of war breaks out.\" We meet Edmond and Aimee while they share a discreet lunch at a riverside hotel, revealing their deep affection for one another and the challenges posed by their differing social standings. As their romance develops, the conversation hints at the political unrest brewing in Europe. This idyllic scene is soon overshadowed by the grim realities of impending war, as both characters face the dual threat of their relationship being scorned by Aimee's father and the dangerous geopolitical landscape about to erupt into conflict. The narrative effectively sets the stage for a tumultuous blend of love and loyalty as society rapidly shifts from peace to the chaos of battle. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
