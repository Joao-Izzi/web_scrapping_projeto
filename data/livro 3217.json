    "resumo": "\"The Light That Lures\" by Percy James Brebner is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set during the tumultuous times of the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolution, the story follows Richard Barrington, a young man who idolizes the heroic figure of Marquis de Lafayette and dreams of fighting for freedom and justice, inspired by the conflict of his era.  The opening of the novel introduces Richard as a contemplative boy on a hummock by Chesapeake Bay, enamored by lofty dreams of heroism and adventure, contrasting sharply with the serene beauty surrounding him. As the narrative unfolds, he encounters the Marquis de Lafayette, who becomes a mentor and a source of inspiration. Lafayette's conversation with Richard reveals themes of duty, honor, and the significance of one's path in life, foreshadowing Richardâ€™s journey from Virginia to France amidst conflict. The scene shifts dramatically as we then meet Richard as a man, traveling with his companion Seth to Paris, where they become embroiled in a web of intrigue and danger as they help a mysterious woman, Jeanne St. Clair, navigate a revolution that threatens their very lives.
