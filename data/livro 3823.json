    "resumo": "\"Economic Effects of the World War upon Women and Children in Great Britain\" by Irene Osgood Andrews is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work examines the significant shifts in the roles and employment of women and children in Great Britain as a result of World War I. It delves into how the war catalyzed an industrial revolution that led to women's increased participation in various sectors, particularly those traditionally held by men.  The opening of the book sets the tone for an analysis of the economic landscape during and after the war, highlighting the dramatic influx of women and children into the workforce. It provides an overview of the change in employment status, noting that as men were conscripted into military service, women stepped into labor roles that were previously closed to them. This transformative period created both opportunities for advancement and challenges regarding wages and working conditions, as the number of women in industrial positions and children's labor needs shifted through the war efforts and subsequent reconstruction phases.
