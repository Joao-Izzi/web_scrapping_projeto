    "resumo": "\"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion\" by B. H. Roberts is a theological discourse written in the early 20th century. The work tackles the nature and being of God as understood within the Mormon faith, emphasizing the distinctive views that diverge from mainstream Christianity. The book is framed around a series of debates and discussions concerning the identity and characteristics of God, particularly in relation to the Prophet Joseph Smith's revelations.  The opening of the text introduces the foundational concepts that form the basis of the subsequent discussions. Roberts begins by asserting that previous misconceptions and misrepresentations about the concept of God have led to widespread confusion. He emphasizes the significance of understanding God as a being with form, citing Joseph Smith's vision of the Father and the Son as two separate personages. The preface details the context of the discourse, which arose from lectures by sectarian ministers critiquing Mormon views on deity, prompting Roberts to defend and clarify the church's beliefs regarding the nature of God and the Godhead. He outlines the structure of the book, which includes a response to a Catholic priest's critique, underscoring the importance of these theological debates to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
