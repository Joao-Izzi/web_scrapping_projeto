    "resumo": "\"A Modern Exodus\" by Violet Guttenberg is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story delves into the complexities of Jewish identity and the rising tide of anti-Semitism in England, set against the backdrop of political and social turmoil. The main character, Lionel Montella, is a young Jewish politician facing a pivotal moment in his career as he navigates both his commitment to his community and his romantic connection with Lady Patricia, a Christian woman.  The opening of the novel takes place on Yom Kippur, where the synagogue is filled with a diverse congregation of Jews, highlighting the various backgrounds and perspectives within the community. Lionel Montella is introduced to readers as a progressive thinker who is deeply concerned about the implications of the recent death of the Prime Minister, Lawrence Campbell, who was a key supporter of Jewish rights. As Lionel contemplates the precarious position of the Jewish community in England, the narrative also touches on personal themes, such as family dynamics, love, and societal expectations, particularly through Lionel's relationship with Lady Patricia. The intricate social landscape and the tension surrounding Jewish identity set the stage for the unfolding drama of love and political struggle in the face of adversity.
