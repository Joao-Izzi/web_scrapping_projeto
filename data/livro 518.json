    "resumo": "\"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry\" by W. B. Yeats is a collection of fairy tales and folklore written in the late 19th century. This anthology brings to life the rich tradition of Irish storytelling, featuring mystical beings and legends from the Irish countryside. With tales that include characters such as fairies, pookas, and ghosts, Yeats aims to share the enchanting folklore that has shaped the cultural landscape of Ireland.  The opening of this collection introduces the concept of fairies, commonly viewed as fallen angels by the peasantry, and outlines their mischievous yet capricious nature. Yeats shares anecdotes and firsthand accounts of the Irish people's beliefs in these elusive beings, describing their interactions with humans and the traditions surrounding their existence. These tales set the stage for deeper explorations of individual stories throughout the anthology, framing a world where the mundane intersects with the magical, and the supernatural still echoes in the lives of those who inhabit rural Ireland.
