    "resumo": "\"Hidden Hand\" by Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story is set primarily within the rugged mountain regions of Virginia, focusing on the life of Major Ira Warfield, a complex and domineering figure known as \"Old Hurricane,\" whose lonely existence is punctuated by dark secrets and family tragedies. The narrative intertwines with the mysterious fate of Capitola, a spirited young girl with a hidden past, whose life becomes entangled with the major's as they confront various challenges in a harsh and unforgiving world.  At the start of the book, the scene is set in the foreboding Hurricane Hall, an isolated mansion facing a fierce storm on the night of Halloween. Major Warfield is depicted as a self-indulgent man of wealth, indulging in his comforts while grappling with his grim responsibilities. The chapter develops tension as a late-night visit from the local parson brings news of an urgent matterâ€”one that compels Warfield to confront his duties as a magistrate, leading to a midnight journey to aid a dying woman. This woman's revealing story, filled with mystery and peril, begins to unravel connections to Capitola, hinting at a deeper narrative involving identity, belonging, and the hidden truths that shape their lives. This setting and early events establish a gothic atmosphere that permeates the book, drawing readers into a tale of intrigue and moral complexity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
