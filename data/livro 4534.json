    "resumo": "\"Der goldene Spiegel: Erzählungen in einem Rahmen\" by Jakob Wassermann is a collection of intertwined short stories written in the early 20th century. The book revolves around the character of Franziska, a young actress grappling with her aspirations and relationships as she navigates a world filled with her wealthy friends and the complexities of her artistic ambitions.  The opening of this work introduces Franziska and her relationships with three young men: Rudolf Borsati, Georg Vinzenz Lamberg, and Cajetan von Prechtl, who are affluent members of society contrasting with her humble beginnings. Franziska is portrayed as a vibrant and aspiring actress who is both pursued and admired, yet feels an ongoing restlessness as she yearns for a more profound sense of life beyond social gatherings and superficial connections. When she mysteriously disappears with a man named Riccardo Troyer, her friends are left with her last gift—a golden mirror, symbolizing the intertwining of their fates and serving as a catalyst for the stories that follow. This intricate setup hints at themes of love, ambition, and the search for identity amidst societal expectations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
