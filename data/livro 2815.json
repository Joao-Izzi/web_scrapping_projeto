    "resumo": "\"The World That Couldn't Be\" by Clifford D. Simak is a science fiction novella published in the mid-20th century. Set on the alien planet Layard, the story explores themes of survival, the relationship between humans and extraterrestrial life, and the complex dynamics of non-verbal communication in environments where traditional social structures do not exist. The narrative focuses on the challenges faced by the protagonist, Gavin Duncan, as he seeks to protect his crop from a dangerous creature known as the Cytha.  In this tale, Duncan, a planter on Layard, becomes embroiled in a hunt for the elusive Cytha after it threatens his valuable \"vua\" crops, which are crucial for the health of the native inhabitants. As he pursues the creature, he is accompanied by a native tracker named Sipar, but their journey quickly turns perilous. Throughout the chase, Duncan confronts supernatural aspects of the Cytha, including its unexpected ability to communicate and manipulate its surroundings. Following a series of dangerous encounters and Sipar's tragic suicide, Duncan ultimately learns that the Cytha is not only an intelligent predator but also a maternal figure for the diverse fauna of Layard. The novella culminates in a precarious bargain between Duncan and the Cytha, where they agree to coexist while maintaining a delicate balance between their respective roles within the ecosystem.
