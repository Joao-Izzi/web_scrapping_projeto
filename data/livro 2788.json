At the start of the book, we meet Mr. and Mrs. Wayne, who discuss their daughter Helen's approaching adolescence and the need for open communication regarding her development into womanhood. Mr. Wayne expounds on the significance of imparting knowledge about self-respect and the moral implications of interactions between young men and women. As Helen yearns for guidance about friendships and the complexities of growing up, we see her wrestling with the societal expectations of young women and the desire for independence. Their dialogue explores the values of purity, the importance of education for women, and the pivotal role mothers play in shaping the character of future generations, setting the stage for a deeper examination of womanhood throughout the text.
