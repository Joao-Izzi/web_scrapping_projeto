    "resumo": "\"De muis, of De gestoorde nachtrust\" by [pseud.] Braga Jr. and Wilhelm Busch is a whimsical narrative poem structured in twelve scenes, likely penned during the late 19th century. This light-hearted tale is centered around the chaos unleashed in the life of a peaceful couple due to a small mouse that intrudes upon their nightly rest, highlighting the disproportionate reactions that minor disturbances can provoke.  The story begins with Sparrebeen and his wife Eva enjoying their nightly routine, but their peaceful slumber is shattered by the sudden appearance of a mouse. As Spar and Eva react with escalating fear and desperation, their attempts to capture the elusive creature lead to a series of comedic mishaps and mayhem. Despite their best efforts, the mouse proves to be clever, evading their traps and creating even more chaos in their home. Ultimately, the tale illustrates not just the absurdity of their fears but also the humor found in domestic life, culminating in a situation where the mouse escapes, leaving the couple to reflect on their exaggerated response to such a minor intruder.
