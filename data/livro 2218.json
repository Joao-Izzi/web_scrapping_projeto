    "resumo": "\"King Olaf's Kinsman\" by Charles W. Whistler is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the tumultuous period of the last Saxon struggle against the Danes in England, focusing on the life of Redwald, the son of a thane, as he confronts the horrors of Viking invasions and battles for his homeland. The work combines a mix of legend and historical facts, particularly involving King Olaf and other significant figures from this era.  The opening of the novel introduces readers to Redwald, a young thane's son, as he witnesses the ominous arrival of the Danes on the shores of East Anglia. Initially filled with the pride of youth, he soon finds himself engulfed in tragedy as his father and the local warriors ride into battle, never to return. As the story unfolds, Redwald must deal with the immediate threat of invasion, rushing to warn his betrothed, Hertha, and rallying the defense against the Danish forces that loom ever closer. The narrative is rich with emotional depth, exploring themes of loss, loyalty, and the call to arms amidst the backdrop of historical upheaval. The stage is set for a gripping tale of bravery, heroism, and the relentless fight for survival against overwhelming odds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
