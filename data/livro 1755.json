    "resumo": "\"Great Epochs in American History, Volume 1\" by Francis W. Halsey is a historical account edited in the early 20th century. The work delves into pivotal moments in American history, starting from the voyages of discovery and early explorations that occurred from 1000 A.D. to 1682. Halsey presents narratives authored by notable historical figures and eyewitnesses, providing a unique insight into these transformative events.  At the start of this volume, the preface establishes an overview of the series, highlighting the intention to chronicle significant epochs through the words of those who experienced them, including Columbus and Washington. The introduction discusses early explorations, hinting at the complexity of discovering America, with arguments that Columbus was not the first. The opening chapters recount the Norse expeditions to Vinland, as well as Columbus's famed voyages that initiated European interest in the Americas. Through engaging accounts of exploration, the early chapters set the stage for understanding the historical context behind the expansion of European presence across the New World.
