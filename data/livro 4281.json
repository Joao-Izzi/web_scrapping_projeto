    "resumo": "\"The Tale of Beowulf, Sometime King of the Folk of the Weder Geats\" by William Morris et al. is an epic poem translated and presented in prose form, written in the late 19th century. The work recounts the legendary exploits of Beowulf, a hero who battles formidable monsters to help King Hrothgar of Denmark, including the malevolent Grendel and Grendel's vengeful mother. The themes of heroism, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil are central to the narrative.  At the start of the tale, we are introduced to the backdrop of Denmark, where Hrothgar, the king, builds a grand mead-hall named Heorot, which becomes the target of Grendel, a monstrous creature descended from Cain. Grendel terrorizes Hrothgar’s warriors, killing them during the night. Hearing of Hrothgar’s plight, Beowulf, a noble warrior from the Geats, sets sail with his men to assist the beleaguered king. Upon arrival, he is warmly received and vows to confront Grendel without weapons, setting the stage for an epic clash between the two. The opening chapters lay the foundation for themes of heroism, legacy, and the supernatural, as well as introducing the main characters and the initial conflict.
