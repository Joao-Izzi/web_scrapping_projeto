    "resumo": "\"The Talking Deaf Man\" by Johann Conrad Amman is a scientific publication written in the late 17th century. This treatise discusses a novel method for teaching individuals who are born deaf to speak articulately. The work delves into the intricacies of vocalization, voice formation, and the education of deaf individuals, showcasing Amman's innovative approach to communication.  In this book, Amman details his systematic method for teaching the deaf to speak, firmly rooted in an understanding of anatomy, voice, and letters. He emphasizes the importance of vocal sound as distinct from mere breath, and articulates the necessary steps to instruct deaf students in recognizing and producing sounds. Using the example of teaching a young deaf girl named Esther Kolard, the author outlines his techniques which include understanding the vibrations in the throat, performing exercises with mirrors, and isolating specific sounds. Through this detailed exploration, Amman not only provides practical advice but also aims to challenge the incredulity surrounding the ability of deaf individuals to learn to communicate verbally.
