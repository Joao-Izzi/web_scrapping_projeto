    "resumo": "\"Mémoires du duc de Rovigo, pour servir à l'histoire de l'empereur Napoléon\" is a historical account written in the early 19th century. The book serves as a firsthand account from the perspective of the Duke of Rovigo, who provides insight into the events and political maneuvers during the time of Emperor Napoleon, particularly focusing on key conferences and negotiations with other nations.   The opening of the memoir details recent political developments related to Napoleon's dealings with Portugal and Russia, specifically during the concluding discussions of the Erfurth conference. It describes how Napoleon received reports from General Junot regarding concessions made with the English in Portugal, and discusses the trust placed in the Russian alliance despite tense international relations, including a negative response from England to peace overtures. The narrative continues with reflections on personal exchanges between Napoleon and his aides, revealing both the intricacies of diplomacy at the time and the complexities of Coulisses, common sentiments and the precarious balance of power that would soon lead to further conflicts.
