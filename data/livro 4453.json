    "resumo": "\"The Assyrian and Hebrew Hymns of Praise\" by Charles Gordon Cumming is a scholarly analysis of religious poetry written in the early 20th century. The work examines the similarities and differences between ancient Assyrian hymns and Hebrew psalms, focusing on their styles, themes, and significance within their respective cultures. Cumming endeavors to provide a comparative framework that will help scholars and readers appreciate the richness of spiritual expression in these ancient texts.  At the start of the book, Cumming outlines his intention to explore the nature and literary merit of Hebrew psalms and Assyrian hymns, emphasizing the historical context in which these works were created. He argues for a broader understanding of Hebrew psalms as part of a larger continuum of religious poetry that intersects with various ancient cultures. The author acknowledges the incomplete preservation of these texts and sets the stage for a detailed examination of different categories of Hebrew psalms, beginning with an exploration of those that are not categorized as hymns. This opening portion establishes a scholarly tone while inviting readers into an intricate study of ancient religious literature. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
