    "resumo": "\"A Little Journey\" by Ray Bradbury is a short story that falls within the science fiction genre, and it was likely written in the early 1950s. The narrative follows an elderly widow named Mrs. Bellowes, who, along with a group of other elderly women, embarks on a surreal quest to travel to Mars and then beyond, in search of God. The story captures themes of hope, disillusionment, and the longing for transcendence in the twilight of life.  The story begins with Mrs. Bellowes's excitement about her impending journey to Mars, facilitated by a man named Mr. Thirkell, who presents it as a path to God. However, her anticipation quickly shifts to skepticism upon discovering the poor conditions of the rest stop and the dubious quality of the rocket. When Thirkell reveals a week-long delay in their launch, the group protests, only to confront the broken-down, decrepit rocket they are meant to board. Despite the feeling of betrayal, Mrs. Bellowes chooses to take a chance on the journey. Ultimately, as the rocket explodes, she and the other women find themselves hurtling through space, seeking solace in the cosmos and feeling a visceral connection to the divine. The story concludes with Mrs. Bellowes embracing her identity and accepting the infinite journey ahead, highlighting the enduring hope and spiritual yearning of the elderly.
