    "resumo": "\"The Romance of Golden Star\" by George Chetwynd Griffith is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the resurrection of Vilcaroya, an Inca prince, who awakens after centuries of deep slumber, presumed dead alongside his beloved, Golden Star. As he navigates this new world, he grapples with lost love and the fate of his people.  The opening of the book introduces us to Professor Martin Lamson and Dr. Laurens Djama, who are exploring a mummy they believe to be Vilcaroya. The professor, an expert in South American archeology, marvels at the mummy's extraordinary state, while Djama theorizes about its potential for revival through a mysterious process. After a week of intense experimentation, Djama successfully resurrects the Inca prince, leading to a whirlwind of emotions and revelations as they learn of his past, including his tragic plight and his devotion to Golden Star. This sets the stage for an adventure that promises the exploration of ancient treasures, the clash of cultures, and the rerouting of destinies across time and space.
