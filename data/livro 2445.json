    "resumo": "\"Illusions: A Psychological Study\" by James Sully is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work delves deeply into the concept of illusions, examining the various types and their origins from both psychological and physiological perspectives. The focus is on understanding the nature of perceptual error and how it relates to the broader processes of human cognition and belief.  The opening of the work sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the topic, beginning with an overview of common misconceptions surrounding illusions. It contrasts common perceptions of illusion as something that excludes rational thought with the idea that everyone is susceptible to illusions under different circumstances. Sully emphasizes the importance of studying illusions from a psychological standpoint, suggesting that this inquiry can illuminate both normal and abnormal mental functioning. He concludes this introductory section by proposing a scientific definition of illusion that encompasses various types of cognitive errors, thereby establishing a framework for the detailed analysis that follows.
