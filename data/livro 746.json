    "resumo": "\"The Merry-go-round\" by W. Somerset Maugham is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story begins to unfold through the interactions of Miss Elizabeth Dwarris, a wealthy and overbearing woman, and her equally stubborn cousin, Miss Ley. The narrative introduces themes of family dynamics, power, and independence, specifically revolving around the tyrannical presence of Miss Dwarris in the lives of her relatives.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Miss Elizabeth Dwarris, who wielded her wealth to manipulate and subdue her poorer relatives. She takes delight in controlling their thoughts and actions, deriving pleasure from their discomfort. Particularly noteworthy is her contentious relationship with Miss Ley, who is uniquely able to challenge Dwarris with her wit and bluntness. Their exchanges hint at a longstanding feud, illustrating the tension between authority and rebellion within family structures. The opening portion effectively sets the stage for a story that promises to explore complex interpersonal relationships and the consequences of power and independence.
