    "resumo": "\"Dere Mable: Love Letters of a Rookie\" by Edward Streeter is a collection of humorous letters written during the early 20th century, specifically around World War I. The book captures the experiences of a young soldier named Bill Smith as he writes to his girlfriend, Mable, detailing his life in the army, the absurdities of military training, and his feelings of homesickness. The letters reflect the camaraderie among soldiers while also providing comedic insights into the challenges they face during wartime.  In this collection, Bill's letters exhibit a blend of humor and vulnerability, as he shares his thoughts about military life, the cold weather, and his longing for Mable. He vividly describes the chaos of camp life, the quirks of fellow soldiers, and the often hilarious misunderstandings of military protocol, such as his encounters with sergeants and captains. As the correspondence progresses, Bill's tone shifts from lighthearted to confused and hurt upon hearing rumors about Mable's loyalty, leading to a poignant conclusion where he decides to end their relationship. Throughout the letters, Streeter's witty style illuminates the experiences of a \"rookie\" soldier, providing readers with a unique perspective on love and war.
