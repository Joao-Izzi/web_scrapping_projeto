    "resumo": "\"Selected Essays of Plutarch, Vol. I\" by Plutarch is a collection of philosophical essays thought to be written in the early second century AD. This work comprises an array of themes that reflect upon various aspects of ethics, education, and social conduct, providing readers insight into the moral landscape of the time. The essays serve to illustrate Plutarch's ideas and philosophical beliefs, ultimately aiming to instruct readers in the art of living a virtuous life.  The opening of the collection presents a preface and introduction that frame the following essays, establishing Plutarch's credentials and the historical context of his work. The translator, T. G. Tucker, notes the essays' significance in understanding the civilization of the middle classes around the year 100 AD. He indicates that these essays are not merely the most renowned of Plutarch's writings, but rather chosen for their representative qualities and the range of engaging topics they cover. The start introduces key themes of education, civic responsibility, virtue, and interpretation of social conduct, laying a foundation for the ensuing discussions, which include a unique allegorical dinner party featuring the Seven Sages of Greece, bringing together wisdom and social interaction.
