    "resumo": "\"Humphrey Bold: A Story of the Times of Benbow\" by Herbert Strang is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows a young boy named Humphrey Bold, who, after the loss of his parents, is adopted by a kind but solitary farmer, Mr. John Ellery. The narrative explores themes of childhood struggles, bullying, and the journey to manhood, particularly focusing on Humphrey's development as he learns to stand up for himself and navigate his relationships with those around him.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Humphrey at the age of eleven, reflecting on his childhood memories with a blend of nostalgia and humor. He recalls the bullying he received from schoolmates, particularly Dick Cludde and Cyrus Vetch, and how he was sheltered by his adoptive father, who prioritized his education and well-being. We witness the pivotal moment when Joe Punchard comes to his aid against his bullies, culminating in a humorous incident involving a barrel that sets the stage for Humphrey's adventures and misadventures. As he navigates challenges, both personal and social, the foundation for his character growth is firmly established in this opening portion, hinting at further developments in his journey.
