    "resumo": "\"The Lhota Nagas\" by J. P. Mills is a monograph written in the early 20th century. This work aims to provide a detailed account of the Lhota Naga tribe, whose unique customs and traits have often been overlooked due to their reclusive nature. The author draws from personal experiences during his time as Assistant Commissioner in Mokokchung, presenting the cultural practices, beliefs, and social structure of the Lhotas, along with insights into notable individuals from the tribe.  The opening of the text introduces the Lhota Nagas, describing their geographic presence in the Naga Hills and outlining previous outsiders' perspectives on their character, often misrepresented as sullen and unfriendly. Mills emphasizes his intention to correct these misconceptions and highlights the importance of documenting the tribe's customs before they risk being lost due to external influences. In the introductory sections, he outlines the monograph's purpose, stating a focus on facts instead of theories, and setting the stage for an exploration of the Lhotas' origins, daily life, laws, religion, and cultural expressions such as folk tales and songs.
