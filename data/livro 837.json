    "resumo": "\"The Poison Tree: A Tale of Hindu Life in Bengal\" by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around the lives of Nagendra Natha Datta, a wealthy landholder, and his wife Surja Mukhi, as they navigate personal and familial challenges in the traditional Hindu context of Bengal. The book highlights the intricacies of love, duty, and the impact of societal norms on individual lives, particularly focusing on the dynamics of marriage and sacrifice within a patriarchal framework.  At the start of the story, Nagendra embarks on a critical journey by boat, urged by his wife Surja Mukhi to be cautious due to the onset of storms. As he travels, he encounters both nature's fury and the realities of Bengali rural life. Concurrently, the opening introduces Kunda Nandini, a young girl facing devastating loss and impending uncertainties after the death of her father. Her connection to Nagendra and the unfolding narrative hints at themes of fate, love, and the societal expectations heaped upon women in the era, setting the stage for a richly woven tale of personal and collective struggles within the cultural tapestry of Bengal.
