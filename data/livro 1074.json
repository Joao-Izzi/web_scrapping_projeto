    "resumo": "\"Freiland: Ein sociales Zukunftsbild\" by Theodor Hertzka is a social utopian novel written in the late 19th century. The work presents a vision for creating a new society based on principles of freedom and economic justice, where laborers receive the full fruits of their work without the interference of private property. The narrative introduces the International Free Society, a group committed to embarking on a practical experiment to resolve the social problems of their time.  The opening of the novel sets the stage for an ambitious initiative as an announcement from the International Free Society appears in various newspapers, signaling their intention to establish a new community in unclaimed territory. This society, led by the respected Dr. Karl Strahl, aims to forge a communal living arrangement that prioritizes the individualâ€™s right to self-determination while ensuring the well-being of all members, including the unemployed and women. As excitement grows, members prepare for an expedition to find suitable land in Central Africa, revealing their plans and the challenges they anticipate along the way, from securing provisions to dealing with hostile tribes. The atmosphere is charged with hope and anticipation for a transformative journey that reflects the broader social ideas circulating during Hertzka's time.
