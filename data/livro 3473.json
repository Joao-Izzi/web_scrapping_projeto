    "resumo": "\"The Earliest Arithmetics in English\" by Robert Steele is a scholarly work written in the early 20th century. This publication compiles and analyzes early arithmetic texts in the English language, focusing primarily on works from the 15th century. The book examines the evolution of arithmetic, the tools and methods used for calculations, and the importance of these texts in the historical context of mathematics.   The opening of this volume presents an introductory exploration of the scarcity of English-language arithmetic texts prior to the 16th century, indicating that Latin dominated mathematical literature at the time. It outlines early mathematical practices, the significance of historical figures such as Sacro Bosco and Alexander de Villa Dei, and the various methodologies employed in arithmetic, such as the use of counting boards and the algorithmic approach to calculations. The introduction serves as a precursor to two main treatises that will be presented within the work, diving into the structure and principles of early arithmetic education.
