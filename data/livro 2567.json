    "resumo": "\"A Source Book of London History, from the earliest times to 1800\" by P. Meadows is a historical account that was likely compiled in the early 20th century. This book presents a curated selection of original sources and contemporary writings on the history of London, spanning from its early origins through the year 1800. The aim is to provide readers with a vivid understanding of the city's development, significant events, and its socio-political evolution over the centuries.  The opening of the work begins with a preface emphasizing the importance of original sources in the study of history to ensure that readers can appreciate the reality and atmosphere of the past. Meadows highlights the challenges of gathering this diverse material, as much of it exists in scattered or inaccessible forms. The text then delves into early references to London, such as its state before the Norman Conquest, illustrating the city's commercial significance during Roman and Saxon times and showcasing how it served as both a trade hub and military stronghold. The subsequent passages promise a detailed exploration of significant events, documents, and societal changes that shaped London throughout these remarkable centuries.
