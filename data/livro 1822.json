    "resumo": "\"The Eighteen Christian Centuries\" by James White is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the significant events and transformations that have shaped Christianity and its influence over eighteen centuries. It likely delves into the interplay between the rise of the Christian church and the political, cultural, and social landscapes of various epochs.  The opening of the work discusses the usefulness and complexity of history, emphasizing the importance of understanding the distinct character of different centuries. White establishes a framework for analyzing the history of Christianity, suggesting that each century can be defined by its unique \"prevailing Thought.\" He begins by focusing on the first century, highlighting the contrasting reigns of Roman emperors, the birth of Christ, and the resulting effect of His teachings on the world. The narrative sets the stage for an exploration of how these early influences contributed to the growth of Christianity amidst the backdrop of the Roman Empire's tumultuous political climate.
