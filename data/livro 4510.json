    "resumo": "\"The Olden Time Series: Vol. 2: The Days of the Spinning-Wheel in New England\" by Henry M. Brooks is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the quaint customs and lifestyles of New England during the period when spinning wheels were commonplace in households, serving as a symbol of industry and domesticity. Brooks compiles anecdotes from old newspapers and personal reminiscences to provide readers with a vivid portrayal of daily life and societal values during that era.  At the start of the book, the author reflects on the nostalgia that accompanies antique items, particularly the spinning wheel, which has become a sought-after artifact in modern times. He sets the scene by contrasting the simplicity and frugality of life in early America before the Revolutionary War with contemporary trends, noting the shift from spinning wheels to modern pianos and the decline in musical appreciation. Through observations and anecdotes collected from historical documents, Brooks dives into various aspects of life, including fashion, economic conditions, and social customs, illustrating how the inhabitants viewed their past with both reverence and critique.
