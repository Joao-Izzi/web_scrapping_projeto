    "resumo": "\"The Optimist\" by E. M. Delafield is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Owen Quentillian as he reflects on his past experiences and relationships with the Morchard family while grappling with his own identity and aspirations.

The opening of the novel introduces Owen Quentillian embarking on a voyage and recalling his childhood connection with the Morchard family, particularly his recollections of Valeria and her siblings. Reflecting on his poignant experiences at St. Gwenllian, Owen navigates memories of interactions with the Canon, his daughters, and the dynamics of their family life. As Owen reconnects with Lucilla and the Canon, he wrestles with feelings of nostalgia and a desire to understand his place in their lives, while Valeria emerges as a significant figure, embodying complexities of personal expectations versus familial duty. The beginning sets the stage for an exploration of relationships, individual aspirations, and the intricacies of family loyalty, eventually leading Owen toward a more profound introspection about partnership and belonging.
