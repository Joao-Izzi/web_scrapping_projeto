    "resumo": "\"Pee-wee Harris Adrift\" by Percy Keese Fitzhugh is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows a young Boy Scout named Pee-wee Harris as he navigates the challenges of having no patrol and the quest to establish himself in the world of scouting. Pee-wee's determination and imagination lead him to discover an unexpected island in the river, setting the stage for an adventure filled with friendship and youthful exuberance.  The opening of \"Pee-wee Harris Adrift\" introduces the main character, Pee-wee, who finds himself without a patrol after his previous attempts to form one fall through. With spring in the air, he feels increasingly isolated from his peers, prompting him to visit fellow scouts, only to feel rejected. In a moment of serendipity, he stumbles upon a small island that has mysteriously appeared in the river. This discovery reignites his spirit and ambition, leading him to envision starting a new patrol based on the newfound island. The interactions with his friends, coupled with his comedic misinterpretations of scouting logistics and law, lay the groundwork for Pee-wee's humorous and heartfelt journey toward camaraderie and adventure.
