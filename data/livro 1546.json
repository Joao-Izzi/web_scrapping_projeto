    "resumo": "\"The Art of Poetry: an Epistle to the Pisos\" by Horace is a classical piece of literature crafted in the 1st century BC. This treatise functions as both a work of literary criticism and an instructional guide, as Horace addresses the Pisos—a Roman family—providing them insights into the craft of poetry, particularly focusing on the Roman dramatic tradition.   At the start of the epistle, Horace introduces his thoughts on poetry, asserting the importance of unity and coherence in artistic endeavors. He critiques poets who deviate into chaos and lack clarity in their works, using vivid metaphors to illustrate his points. He establishes a conversational tone, allowing readers to feel a personal connection to his advice. The opening segments discuss the necessity of structure, the dangers of excessive ambition, and the role of audience engagement, setting the stage for deeper reflections on poetic form and function. Overall, the beginning emphasizes Horace's dual role as both an educator and a peer, providing timeless wisdom relevant to poets of any era. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
