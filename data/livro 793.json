    "resumo": "\"Viisi viikkoa ilmapallossa\" by Jules Verne is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Dr. Samuel Fergusson, an adventurous spirit and a well-known explorer, as he prepares for an audacious journey to traverse Africa using a balloon. The narrative delves into themes of exploration, ambition, and the challenges faced by those daring to push the boundaries of human knowledge.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the vibrant scene of a meeting at the Royal Geographical Society in London, where Fergusson's bold proposal to traverse Africa by balloon generates excitement and skepticism among members. A fervent speaker ignites national pride and support for the mission, resulting in the society pledging a substantial sum of money for the expedition. As the gathering buzzes with anticipation, we glimpse Fergusson's character—calm, resolute, and driven by a sense of destiny. The opening sets the stage for a thrilling adventure framed by the historical context of geographical exploration during the Victorian era, promising encounters with uncharted territories and the trials of human resilience against the elements.
