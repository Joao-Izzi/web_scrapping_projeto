    "resumo": "\"Collected Poems: Volume Two\" by Alfred Noyes is a collection of poetry likely written in the early 20th century. This volume showcases a range of themes including nature, love, death, and the human experience, reflecting the depth of emotion and observation characteristic of Noyesâ€™s work. Each poem captures moments of beauty, longing, and reflection, making this anthology a diverse exploration of poetic thought.  The opening of the collection features several poems, starting with \"Mist in the Valley,\" which describes a contemplative journey through a mist-bound landscape, evoking feelings of solitude and introspection. This is followed by \"A Song of the Plough,\" a vivid depiction of the life of ploughmen against the backdrop of nature's cycles, and \"The Banner,\" which speaks to the enduring spirit of hope and renewal. Each piece uses rich imagery and rhythmic language to convey deep emotions and observations about life, setting the stage for the overarching themes that Noyes continues to explore throughout the volume.
