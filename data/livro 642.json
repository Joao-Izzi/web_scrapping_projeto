    "resumo": "\"The London Pleasure Gardens of the Eighteenth Century\" by Warwick Wroth, assisted by Arthur Edgar Wroth, is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work explores the rich and diverse history of London's pleasure gardens during the 1700s, illustrating both their social significance and cultural evolution throughout that century.  The opening of this study presents an engaging preface that establishes the intent behind the compilation—a history of London’s pleasure gardens that not only collects scattered information but also enriches it with new material gathered from various cultural sources, including newspapers and prints. The preface highlights the transformation of these gardens from humble beginnings as places for simple social gatherings to grand establishments featuring elaborate music and entertainment. Wroth sets the stage by describing the early experiences of visitors, detailing settings such as Vauxhall Gardens, and foreshadowing later developments, from the types of entertainment offered to the diverse social classes that frequented these venues.
