    "resumo": "\"The Trawler\" by James B. Connolly is a novel published in the early 20th century, specifically in 1914. The book explores the lives of fishermen in Gloucester, Massachusetts, emphasizing the dangers of their profession and the personal tragedies that can occur at sea. The narrative intertwines themes of loss, camaraderie, and the harsh realities of life on the water.  The story centers around the Snow family, particularly the tragedy of Arthur Snow, who is lost at sea during a tumultuous fishing expedition captained by Hugh Glynn. The novel unfolds through the eyes of Simon Kippen, a friend of Arthur, who later ships out with Captain Glynn. As the narrative progresses, Simon witnesses the complexities of life at sea, including the inner struggles of the men who risk their lives daily in pursuit of a catch. The relationship between Simon and Mary Snow, Arthur's niece, adds a personal dimension as Simon grapples with his feelings for her amid the backdrop of grief and loss. Ultimately, the book serves as a meditation on sacrifice, the bonds forged among fishermen, and the indomitable spirit required to face the ocean's relentless challenges.
