    "resumo": "\"Roughing It, Part 1\" by Mark Twain is a personal narrative written during the late 19th century that captures the author's experiences during a formative journey to the American West. Twain recounts his adventures, filled with humor and wit, as he embarks on a long voyage from Missouri to Nevada, taking on the role of private secretary to his brother, who was appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory. The overarching theme appears to center on the exploration of the West and the unique characters and incidents that populated that era.  The beginning of \"Roughing It\" introduces readers to Twain's longing for adventure as he reflects on his brother's exciting new role. Filled with envy and imagination, Twain eagerly accepts the position of private secretary and quickly prepares for the journey. The narrative paints a vivid picture of the travel experience, starting with the dull boat ride up the Missouri River, the complications in St. Joseph regarding baggage restrictions, and the switch to an overland stagecoach. Twainâ€™s keen observations humorously depict the various quirks of his companions and the peculiar challenges faced during their travels, setting the tone for a journey that promises unexpected trials and tales in the untamed American West.
