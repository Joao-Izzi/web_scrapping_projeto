    "resumo": "\"The Blue Raider: A Tale of Adventure in the Southern Seas\" by Herbert Strang is an adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows four main characters who find themselves stranded on a beach in New Guinea after their steamer is attacked by a German raider. As they navigate their dire circumstances, the group faces not only the physical challenges of survival but also the looming threat of cannibals and the mysteries of the uncharted land.  At the start of the tale, the focus is on the survival of Phil Trentham and his companions, including the boatswain Josiah Grinson and the mate Ephraim Meek, after their ship has been destroyed. They land on a seemingly desolate beach encumbered by steep cliffs, contemplating their fate amid discussions of pasts filled with perilous encounters. As they explore their surroundings, they stumble upon the remnants of a wrecked French ship, realizing the past adventures may hold the key to their future survival. The opening sets a tense atmosphere, hinting at both human threats and the unknown dangers of the island, as they endeavor to find a path back to safety.
