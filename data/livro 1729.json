    "resumo": "\"Hoof and Claw\" by Charles G. D. Roberts is a collection of animal stories written in the early 20th century. The book explores the lives and challenges of various creatures in the wild, often highlighting themes of survival, instinct, and the complexities of the natural world. Through richly drawn characters like a bear raised by a dog and a wise bison leading its herd, Roberts captures the essence of wilderness life, making it an engaging read for those interested in nature and storytelling.  The opening of \"Hoof and Claw\" introduces readers to the story of a bear cub, just born and hidden in a den, as it is discovered by a woodsman in the wilderness. After the woodsman shoots the mother bear out of fear for his own safety, he adopts the orphaned cub, which he affectionately names Woof, and the narrative delves into Woof's early experiences with his new life. Raised by a retriever dog, Jinny, he navigates childhood believing he is a dog, leading to humorous and touching moments that highlight both the absences and joys of his dual identity. This charming start sets the stage for a series of tales reflecting lifeâ€™s tangled relationships within the animal kingdom. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
