    "resumo": "\"L'enfant prodigue du Vésinet\" by Tristan Bernard is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Robert Nordement, a young man navigating family expectations and his search for independence after the war. As he grapples with societal pressures, he seeks to escape a predetermined life, particularly a marriage to an unappealing young woman named Irma Ourson, which his parents are pushing him toward.

Robert feels isolated within his family, struggling with the recent loss of his friend and the expectations placed upon him. As he contemplates his future and his parents' ambitions for him, he tries to assert his independence, resulting in plans to escape to Brittany. However, he finds himself forced into a new role as a tutor to the eccentric Orega family, where he encounters a world of emotional complexity involving young Esteban Orega. The narrative sets the stage for Robert's journey of self-discovery amid familial pressure and societal obligations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
