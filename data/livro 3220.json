    "resumo": "\"The Church Handy Dictionary\" by Anonymous is a reference work written in the late 19th century. This dictionary aims to provide accessible definitions and explanations of terms relating to the Church of England, designed for both clergy and laity. It serves as a practical resource for those engaged in church activities, Sunday schools, and the study of Church history and liturgy.  The opening of the dictionary presents a dedication to the Right Reverend Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln, highlighting the work's ecclesiastical significance. It also includes a preface that sets the context, stating that while the book is a compilation from various sources, it maintains the perspective of the Church of England. The early entries cover key terms and practices, such as \"Altar,\" \"Baptism,\" and \"Absolution,\" outlining both their definitions and relevant historical or liturgical contexts. This summary emphasizes the bookâ€™s purpose as a reference guide to important church concepts for a contemporary audience. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
