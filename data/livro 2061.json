    "resumo": "\"Anglo-Saxon Solidarity\" by Herbert Adams Gibbons is a historical account written in the early 20th century, specifically in the early 1920s. The book delves into the idea of solidarity among English-speaking nations, particularly focusing on the relationships between the United States and Great Britain. Gibbons critiques the platitudinous remarks often made during celebrations of Anglo-Saxon heritage and contests that genuine understanding and acknowledgment of political relationships and cultural differences are essential for meaningful solidarity.  In this work, Gibbons argues that while many American orators celebrate their Anglo-Saxon lineage, they often overlook the complex dynamics of American society, which includes a multitude of ethnic backgrounds. He emphasizes the necessity for an inclusive approach, recognizing that the contributions of non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants to the United States are fundamental to its identity. The author asserts that true solidarity cannot be rooted solely in historical blood ties; instead, it must be founded on shared ideals, common interests, and a collective moral perspective. He advocates for a nuanced understanding of Anglo-American relations and the importance of fostering unity while respecting the diverse cultural fabric that constitutes American society.
