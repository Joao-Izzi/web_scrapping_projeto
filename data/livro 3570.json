    "resumo": "\"Strange Stories of the Civil War\" by Robert Shackleton et al. is a collection of narratives and fictional tales centered around the American Civil War, written in the early 20th century. The book aims to evoke the emotional experiences and memories of the war, using both actual historical events and imaginative storytelling. It includes various accounts from different perspectives, highlighting the heroism and personal struggles faced by individuals during this tumultuous time in history.  The opening of the book sets the tone with a prologue that emphasizes the disconnect younger generations may feel towards the Civil War, framing it as an effort to preserve memories of heroism and patriotism. The first narrative, titled \"A Boy's Impressions of the Civil War,\" is told from the perspective of a young child witnessing the war's events and their impact on his community in Pittsburg. Through his recollections of soldiers marching, the emotional turbulence surrounding battles and losses, as well as the excitement of military preparations, the boy captures both the innocence of youth and the grim realities of war. The narrative transitions from personal memories to the collective experience of a nation engaged in conflict, establishing a rich emotional context for the stories that follow.
