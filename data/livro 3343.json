    "resumo": "\"Some Persons Unknown\" by E. W. Hornung is a novel written in the late 19th century. This story revolves around the Harwood family, particularly focusing on the delicate yet spirited young boy Kenyon and his interactions with his cricketing hero, C. J. Forrester, as they navigate themes of childhood, adventure, and familial bonds.\"   \"At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to Kenyon Harwood, an eleven-year-old boy with a passion for cricket, who is being looked after by his older sister Ethel. Kenyon's behavior is reckless, stemming from both his youthful exuberance and the trauma of losing his mother. As the day progresses, anticipation builds for the arrival of C. J. Forrester, a cricketer Kenyon idolizes, and this meeting becomes a pivotal moment for not only Kenyon's passion for the sport but also for his relationship with his father, Mr. Harwood, who struggles with connecting to his children. The opening chapters lay the groundwork for exploring Kenyon's vibrant spirit juxtaposed against his physical frailty and his hopeful aspirationsâ€”themes that become central to the narrative.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
