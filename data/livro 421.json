    "resumo": "\"Tales and Novels of J. de La Fontaine — Volume 13\" by Jean de La Fontaine is a collection of fables and tales written during the 17th century, a time characterized by the flourishing of literary and philosophical thought in France. This particular volume weaves narratives that often carry moral lessons, centering around themes of love, fate, and the complexities of human relationships.   In \"St. Julian's Prayer,\" the protagonist, Reynold D'Ast, faces a series of misfortunes beginning with a robbery by three deceptive men who feigned companionship. Despite his initial belief in the protective power of a prayer he recites, Reynold finds himself alone, cold, and destitute. However, luck turns when he receives shelter from a noble widow who mistakes him for someone of good standing, allowing for a romantic encounter between them. Their unexpected union serves as a critique of social class and appearance, suggesting that fortune can favor the deserving irrespective of their current state. Ultimately, Reynold's fortunes are restored, and the tale ends with a reflection on the importance of prayer and the whims of fate, emphasizing that in times of hardship, unexpected kindness can lead to unexpected rewards.
