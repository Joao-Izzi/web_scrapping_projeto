The story unfolds in a serene setting around the Cistercian abbey of Maulbronn, during the time of Abbot Albrecht, introducing themes of art, memory, and human relationships through the experiences of the monk Diether. The initial chapters promise rich character development and a deep exploration of the spiritual and artistic life within the monastic community.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to the peaceful ambience of a Pentecost Sunday at the Maulbronn abbey, where the monk Diether reflects on his memories and the beauty around him. As he interacts with his fellow monks, we sense his connection with art and a longing for something greater, hinting at a story that will intertwine his artistic aspirations with spiritual devotion. The opening establishes a contemplative tone, blending the tranquility of monastic life with Diether's inner journey, suggesting an exploration of faith, art, and the human experience along his path.
