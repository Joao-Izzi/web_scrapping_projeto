    "resumo": "\"The Extermination of the American Bison\" by William T. Hornaday is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work focuses on the discovery, life history, and near extinction of the American bison, shedding light on both the animal itself and the tragic consequences of human intervention. Hornaday aims to raise awareness about the perils of wanton destruction of wildlife through the story of the bison's decline.  The opening of the book outlines the initial encounters Europeans had with the American bison, starting with Montezuma's menagerie in the 16th century. Hornaday describes how explorers and settlers came across bison in various parts of North America, emphasizing their vast geographical distribution and abundance. The narrative reveals the profound impact of human activity, such as hunting and habitat destruction, on the bison population, setting the stage for the subsequent discussion on the species' gradual extermination and the urgent need for conservation efforts.
