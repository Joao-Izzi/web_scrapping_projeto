Cockerell is a travel journal that documents the author's extensive journeys through Europe and the Levant during the early 19th century. As a young architect and artist, the author embarks on a mission to study and sketch significant architectural sites, including Greek temples and antiquities, amidst the sociopolitical backdrop of a tumultuous Europe. The book provides insights into Cockerell's personal observations of contemporary life, culture, and architecture in regions like Turkey and Greece.  The opening of the journal captures the beginning of Cockerell's voyage, detailing his departure from London and subsequent adventures aboard the despatch vessel \"Black Joke\", where he sails toward Constantinople. Along the way, he encounters a mixture of tension and camaraderie with fellow travelers and captures the excitement of seafaring adventures, including the capture of a French prize ship and interactions with its crew. Cockerell's youthful enthusiasm and artistic ambitions are evident as he meticulously details his initial experiences, setting the stage for a rich exploration of the historical and architectural wonders he will document throughout his travels.
