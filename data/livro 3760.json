    "resumo": "\"Olivia: or, It was for her sake\" by Charles Garvice is a romantic novel written in the late 19th century. The book introduces the charming young Olivia Vanley, who finds herself entangled in a web of mystery and intrigue involving a new neighbor, Mr. Faradeane, who has mysteriously purchased a local property. As the story unfolds, themes of love, societal expectations, and personal secrets begin to emerge.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to a picturesque village in Devonshire where Olivia lives with her family. During a tea gathering with an old solicitor, Mr. Sparrow, and her aunt, Miss Amelia Vanley, they discuss the strange behavior of Mr. Faradeane, who has taken up residence at The Dellâ€”a cottage he recently bought under mysterious circumstances. Olivia's curiosity is piqued as the conversation reveals that Faradeane prohibits female visitors and maintains a reclusive lifestyle, raising speculations among the guests. Amidst this chatter, Olivia's thoughts drift towards her feelings for Lord Granville, a young man with whom she shares a deeper connection. The blend of romance and the enigma surrounding Mr. Faradeane sets the stage for the unfolding drama and relationships within the story. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
