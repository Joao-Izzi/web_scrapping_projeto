    "resumo": "\"The Great Hunger\" by Johan Bojer is a novel written during the early 20th century. The story centers on the lives of young boys who, filled with mischief and dreams of adventure, decide to take to the sea fishing, leading to unexpected encounters and events that shape their futures. The tale unfolds in a rural Norwegian fishing village, highlighting the innocence and ambition of its characters against a backdrop of harsh and changing realities.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to a tumultuous scene at a fjord where a fierce storm wreaks havoc on local fishermen. In the midst of this, two boys, Peer Troen and Martin Bruvold, concoct a plan to set out for deep-sea fishing, showcasing their youthful adventurous spirit. As the chapter progresses, they gather their friends, including the timid Klaus and the somewhat awkward Peter, to embark on their daring escapade. Their fearless venture leads them to capture a formidable Greenland shark, creating a moment of chaos and excitement. However, the stormy setting also symbolizes the difficulties they will face in life, foreshadowing struggles with identity and aspirations as the story develops. The opening captures a blend of humor, courage, and foreshadowing that invites readers into their world of youthful ambition contrasted with the harshness of reality.
