    "resumo": "\"The Monastery of Petschenga: Sketches of Russian Lapland\" by J. A. Friis is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work provides an exploration of the Monastery of Petschenga, delving into its historical and legendary significance within the context of Russian Lapland. The narrative primarily focuses on the founding of the monastery by the figure Trifon and intertwines rich descriptions of the surrounding landscapes and the lives of its inhabitants.  At the start of the narrative, the author invites readers on a journey to the northern regions of Lapland, described as untouched and pristine. The opening portion introduces a protagonist who, while exploring the region, discovers a large millstone, which sparks curiosity regarding its origins and hints at the presence of a once-thriving community. Through an encounter with a local Lapp, the protagonist learns of the monks who used to inhabit the area, setting the stage for exploration into the history of the monastery. As he gathers tales and information about the past, the author effectively establishes a sense of wonder about the relationship between the land and its historical figures, such as Trifon, the founder of the monastery.
