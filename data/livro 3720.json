    "resumo": "\"Abraham Lincoln's Lost Speech, May 29, 1856\" by Abraham Lincoln is a historical account presented as a transcript of a speech delivered during the first Republican State Convention in Illinois. This speech, which has been preserved through the notes of H. C. Whitney, encapsulates Lincolnâ€™s ardent opposition to the expansion of slavery into free territories, a pivotal issue in American politics during the mid-19th century. The text was produced in the late 19th century as a souvenir for the Eleventh Annual Lincoln Dinner of the Republican Club in New York, happening in the context of an evolving nation grappling with moral and political divisions over slavery.  The speech itself is a passionate call to action against the injustices associated with the Nebraska bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, emphasizing that unless public sentiment shifts in favor of freedom, violence will ensue. Lincoln addresses the urgency of maintaining Kansas as a free state, uniting various factions within the Republican movement and imploring his audience to suppress personal grievances for a greater common cause. Throughout his address, Lincoln invokes the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence and warns against the dangers of legislative efforts that could further entrench slavery, ultimately urging his peers to stand firm for the cause of liberty and justice.
