    "resumo": "\"Whiskaboom\" by Alan Arkin is a whimsical science fiction story written in the mid-20th century. The narrative centers around the character Jack, an eccentric and determined inventor who becomes obsessed with his experiments, leading to unintended consequences that challenge his existence. The book captures themes of ambition, family dynamics, and the comedic misadventures that arise from Jack's relentless pursuit of scientific achievement.  The story unfolds as Jack moves into the home of Mr. and Mrs. Burroughs, where he isolates himself for the sake of conducting his groundbreaking experiments. As he works tirelessly on his invention—resulting in strange sounds like \"whiskaboom\"—he inadvertently creates chaos that affects not only himself but the very structure of the house. A mishap causes Jack to become flat, diminished in substance as he grapples with the repercussions of his scientific aspirations. The Burroughs, rather than abandoning him, decide to care for Jack, showcasing their affection and concern in the face of absurdity. Eventually, Jack realizes that he needs help from his father, leading to a comedic yet touching exploration of familial ties and the fine line between genius and folly.
