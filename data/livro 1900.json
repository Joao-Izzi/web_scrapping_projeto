    "resumo": "\"Martha; or, The Fair at Richmond\" by Friedrich von Flotow and W. Friedrich is an operatic libretto adapted for use in schools, reflecting the style of works produced during the late 19th century. The narrative revolves around themes of mistaken identity, love, and social class distinctions, set against the backdrop of a lively rural fair in Richmond where the lives of various characters intertwine.  The story follows Lady Harriet, who, feeling trapped in her aristocratic life, disguises herself as a servant girl named Martha to explore the fair and seek adventure. Along with her devoted maid Nancy, she finds herself in amusing and romantic escapades with two gentlemen, Lionel and Plunket, who are in search of new household staff. As a comedy of errors unfolds, identities blur and true feelings emerge, leading to a tangled web of love and mischief. Throughout the opera, the characters grapple with their social roles and personal desires, ultimately leading to moments of revelation and reconciliation, reinforcing the notion that love transcends class boundaries.
