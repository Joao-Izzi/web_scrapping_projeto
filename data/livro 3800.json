    "resumo": "\"The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" by William Shakespeare is a classic tragedy written during the early 17th century. This renowned play follows the complex character of Prince Hamlet as he grapples with themes of revenge, madness, and morality after the death of his father, and the swift remarriage of his mother to his uncle, Claudius, who becomes king. As the story unfolds, Hamlet encounters supernatural elements, including the ghost of his father, which compels him to seek the truth behind his death.  At the start of \"Hamlet,\" the opening scene establishes a sense of foreboding on the battlements of Elsinore Castle, where sentinels are keeping watch. They are soon joined by Horatio, Hamlet's friend, who has been summoned to witness a mysterious apparition resembling the deceased King Hamlet. As the guards discuss the ghost's appearance and its implications for the state of Denmark, Hamlet is introduced in a royal context, revealing his heavy sorrow over his father's death and his mother's hasty marriage to Claudius. This sense of unease and the burden of Hamlet's emotional turmoil are central to the unfolding drama, setting the stage for the exploration of themes such as doubt, grief, and the quest for truth.
