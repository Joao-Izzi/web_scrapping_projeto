    "resumo": "\"Mousey: or, Cousin Robert's Treasure\" by Eleanora H. Stooke is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the character Mousey, whose real name is Arabella, as she navigates her new life after the death of her mother. Following this tragedy, she faces uncertainty about her future and is taken in by her eccentric cousin Robert Harding, who is perceived as miserly and eccentric.  The opening portion of the book introduces Mousey shortly after her mother's funeral, where family members discuss her future care. Mousey is depicted as a sensitive and shy girl who struggles with her loss but is comforted by her faith. Amidst the family dynamics, Mr. Harding offers her a surprising proposition: to come live with him, thus placing her in a situation filled with tension and the potential for growth. The chapter cleverly captures Mousey's emotions and the perceptions others have about her new home. As she contemplates her future, themes of poverty, kindness, and the complexities of familial relationships are set to unfold throughout the narrative. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
