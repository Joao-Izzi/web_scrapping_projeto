    "resumo": "\"The World English Bible (WEB): Habakkuk\" by Anonymous is a prophetic text that falls within the framework of biblical literature, likely written in the ancient period, specifically during the time of the Hebrew Bible's compilation. This book addresses profound themes of justice, faith, and the righteousness of God amidst societal turmoil and violence. Habakkuk, the prophet, raises questions about the suffering of the righteous under the rule of the wicked, seeking understanding of God's plan in a seemingly unjust world.  The text is structured around a dialogue between Habakkuk and God, beginning with Habakkuk's lamentations about the violence and injustice he observes in society. He questions why God seems indifferent to the plight of the righteous while allowing the wicked to prosper, specifically highlighting the rise of the Chaldeans as an instrument of punishment. God responds by assuring Habakkuk that justice will eventually prevail, urging him to trust in the divine plan. In the final chapter, Habakkuk offers a prayer of awe and praise, expressing a deep faith that ultimately, despite present hardships, he will rejoice in God's salvation and strength. The book emphasizes living by faith, even when circumstances appear dire. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
