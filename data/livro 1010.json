    "resumo": "\"Partners: A Novel\" by E. Werner is a work of fiction written in the late 19th century. The narrative revolves around the complex relationships among three main characters—Jessie, a young heiress, her guardian Sandow, and Gustave Sandow, the guardian's brother who has just arrived from Europe. Central to the story is a conflict surrounding Jessie's future and the societal expectations tied to marriage, as she grapples with her independence against her uncle's plans for her to marry Gustave.  The opening of the novel presents a tense meeting between Jessie and her guardian, Sandow, discussing her future, which he believes is secured by an advantageous marriage. Jessie is combative, insisting on emotional fulfillment over financial security and expressing disdain for Gustave, whom she views as self-serving. Their initial interactions are filled with a sense of unease, as Jessie's idealistic notions clash with Sandow's pragmatic approach. The arrival of Gustave sets the stage for further complications, as he is caught between familial duties and his emotional desires, particularly as he secretly harbors feelings for another—a young woman named Frida, whom he plans to bring into Jessie's life under the guise of needing an acolyte for assistance, setting off a chain of events that will challenge all their beliefs about love, duty, and personal agency.
