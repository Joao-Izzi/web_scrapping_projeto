The narrative follows Owen Cunning, an Irish shoemaker who has chosen the isolated Devil's Kitchen on Mackinac Island as his home and workshop.

Through their interactions, the story reveals Owen's ambivalence towards the surrounding cultures, his rugged independence, and the complexities of human connection in a rapidly changing world.
