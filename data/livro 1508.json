    "resumo": "“Cours familier de Littérature - Volume 26” by Alphonse de Lamartine is a literary critique written in the late 19th century. The book serves as a monthly discussion on various literary topics, notably examining the works of influential authors such as Molière and Shakespeare. The primary focus in this volume appears to be a comparative analysis of these two titans of literature, exploring their contributions to their respective cultures and the nature of their artistic expression.  The opening of the volume introduces a conversation between Lamartine and the legacies of Molière and Shakespeare. It reflects on Molière as the embodiment of art in an established culture, while Shakespeare is portrayed as a raw talent emerging from a less refined literary background. The discussion touches on their humble beginnings in the theater, their experiences as they navigated through societal expectations, and their respective influences on the literary landscape. Shakespeare's journey from obscurity to acclaim, contrasted with Molière's establishment in a more polished environment, sets the stage for a deeper analysis of how both writers impacted the evolution of drama and comedy. The beginning serves as a gateway into larger themes of genius, culture, and the human condition reflected in literature. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
