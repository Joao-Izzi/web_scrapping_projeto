    "resumo": "\"The Wolf-Leader\" by Alexandre Dumas is a novel written in the mid-19th century. This work weaves a tale rich in fantasy, inspired by legends of the author's youth, featuring a young boy named Thibault and his tumultuous interaction with wolves and a rustic family life intertwined with the supernatural. The story captures themes of adventure, folklore, and the trials of growing up.  The opening of the novel sets a reflective tone, as the narrator considers his past and recollections tied to his childhood in a town surrounded by forests. It introduces Mocquet, a keeper who provides an intriguing mix of charm and superstition; he has been plagued by nightmares linked to a witch in the village. This backdrop of mystical elements is quickly elevated when the narrator, now older, prepares for an adventure with Mocquet to confront the wolves lurking in the woods, hinting at an unfolding tale of courage and revelation. The atmosphere is steeped in nostalgia, as memories blend with the excitement of the hunt and the supernatural lore of the area. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
