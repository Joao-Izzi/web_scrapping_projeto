    "resumo": "\"Nessuno un bacio: Dramma in tre atti e un epilogo\" by Roberto Bracco is a theatrical play written in the early 20th century. This drama unfolds primarily in a villa near Naples and introduces a complex web of relationships, exploring themes of love, desire, and social interactions. The characters include Tina di Lorenzo as the protagonist and others such as Enrico Carmineti, Corrado Liberti, and Clotilde Carmineti, who navigate their emotions amidst societal expectations.  The opening of the play sets the stage in a lively and colorful villa living room, where we first meet the De Planes couple, who are in a state of annoyance due to the absence of their servant and are determined to confront Clotilde about Corrado's improper behavior towards their daughter. The dialogue introduces a comedic yet tense dynamic between the characters, highlighting their varying perspectives on relationships and personal grievances. Enrico, emerging as the young seminarian, navigates interactions with both Corrado, who seems to have a rather cavalier attitude, and his cousin Nanetta, who expresses a strong will and independence. As the scene progresses, underlying tensions and complex pasts hint at relationships that will unfold throughout the drama. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
