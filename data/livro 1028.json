    "resumo": "\"The Brass Bowl\" by Louis Joseph Vance is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Daniel Maitland, a gentleman with a reputation for being somewhat reckless and adventurous, who finds himself inexplicably drawn to a mysterious woman after a planned evening of social engagements in New York City. The narrative unfolds as Maitland grapples with his boredom and reflects on his life choices while encountering a series of unusual and suspenseful events that hint at a deeper intrigue.  The opening of the novel introduces Daniel Maitland as he returns from a long car ride with friends, already weary of the evening's expected festivities. Upon arriving at his apartment, he is perplexed by the sight of a young woman exiting the bachelor-only building he owns. This moment sets off a chain of events culminating in Maitland discovering a woman's handprint in the dust on his desk, suggesting an intruder's recent presence. His curiosity leads him to overlook his planned outing, opting instead to investigate the significance of this mysterious woman's intrusion. The narrative is laden with hints of romance and adventure, setting the stage for a plot driven by suspense, misunderstandings, and an unexpected meeting of personalities.
