    "resumo": "\"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" by Vicente Blasco Ib치침ez is a historical novel written during the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around the lives of Julio Desnoyers and his romantic entanglements amidst the looming shadow of war. Set in Paris before World War I, the story unfolds with the atmospheric tension of an impending global conflict and explores themes of love and societal upheaval.  The opening of the novel introduces Julio Desnoyers, who impatiently awaits his lover, Marguerite, in the garden of the Chapelle Expiatoire. The scene captures the serene yet anxiety-laden ambiance of Paris as rumors of war stir the city. Desnoyers' observations about the bustling garden and its inhabitants reflect the growing tension of the era, marked by a palpable concern about the looming war with Germany. As Desnoyers reminisces about his recent travels and worries about the situation back home, he firmly remains optimistic about the future. The introduction not only sets up the relationship between the main characters but also serves as a backdrop to the broader societal anxieties enveloping pre-war Europe.
