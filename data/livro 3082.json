    "resumo": "\"Vihreät sisaret\" by George Sand is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around a young lawyer named Nivières who is sent to the picturesque Ionis Castle to handle a delicate legal matter involving the noble d'Ionis family. Throughout the narrative, themes of love, duty, and the supernatural intertwine as Nivières learns about the enchanting yet haunting legends surrounding the castle and its past inhabitants.  The opening of the novel introduces Nivières as he travels to the castle to discuss a legal issue with the beautiful Madame d'Ionis. He grapples with his desire to be a writer rather than a lawyer, caught between familial obligations and personal dreams. Upon arriving, he encounters a mix of characters, including two elderly women who serve as Madame d'Ionis' family, who hint at the mysteries of the castle through mention of the three sisters associated with its history. As the plot unfolds, Nivières becomes increasingly intrigued by the legends surrounding these \"green sisters,\" who are said to haunt the castle and are believed to hold the key to the family's fortunes. This mysterious setting sets the stage for a captivating exploration of both emotional and supernatural conflicts. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
