    "resumo": "\"Amour, Amour, Dear Planet!\" by Mark Clutter is a science fiction novel written in the early 1950s. The story revolves around Spacecaptain Jan Obrien, who is taken hostage by a sect known as the Mohcans in a post-apocalyptic world where pleasure and science have been outlawed. The book explores themes of rebellion, the nature of love, and the struggle for survival in a dystopian setting.  In the narrative, Jan, who is intoxicated and disoriented, crash-lands in the midst of a Mohcan festival and soon finds himself in a precarious situation. Captured along with a woman he had picked up, he learns that the Mohcans intend to seize his spaceship to escape to an uninhabited world, free from the evils of pleasure. The plot unfolds as Jan becomes a reluctant part of their plans, dealing with the dangers posed by the sect and the unexpected dynamics that evolve among crew members, Mohcan women, and peculiar bird-like creatures on an uncharted planet. As chaos ensues, he navigates alliances, betrayal, and an awakening understanding of love amidst survival. Ultimately, the storyline examines how human relationships are tested under extreme circumstances, culminating in the blending of new cultures in an alien environment.
