    "resumo": "\"Twice Bought\" by R. M. Ballantyne is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story unfolds in the backdrop of the American West, focusing on the struggles of Tom Brixton, a young miner who becomes entangled in a life of gambling and theft. As he navigates the harsh realities of gold digging, Brixton's moral compass is tested when he resorts to desperate measures to reclaim what he believes was stolen from him.  The opening of the novel introduces Tom Brixton and his friend Fred Westly as they work at a gold dig site, revealing Brixton's reckless gambling habits that lead him to lose all his possessions to a notorious bully named Gashford. Frustrated and determined to get back what he lost, Brixton makes the fateful decision to steal from Gashford, setting off a chain of events that will see him become an outlaw with a heavy conscience. As he grapples with his choices, he finds himself pursued by the community that once embraced him, leading to moments of intense moral conflict and external danger as he must face the consequences of his actions. This opening lays a foundation for a tale of redemption and the search for personal integrity amid the lawlessness of the frontier. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
