    "resumo": "\"The Survivors of the Chancellor\" by Jules Verne is a nautical adventure novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers on the voyage of the ship Chancellor, detailing the perils faced by its crew and passengers after a catastrophic fire onboard. The narrative follows J. R. Kazallon, a passenger whose observations give insight into both the ship's desperate situation and the personalities of the individuals aboard, including the troubled captain and the brave first mate, Robert Curtis.  At the start of the novel, the Chancellor sets sail from Charleston, meandering through the bay with Captain Huntly at the helm. As the voyage progresses, Kazallon begins to note the captain's unusual behavior and the crew's whispers of concern. Tension mounts when a fire breaks out in the cargo hold, threatening the lives of everyone on board. The opening chapters establish the ship's dire circumstances, the dynamics among passengers, and introduce key characters such as the devoted M. Letourneur and his son, along with the other diverse passengers aboard, setting the stage for a gripping tale of survival against disaster at sea. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
