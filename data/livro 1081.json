    "resumo": "\"English Men of Letters: Crabbe\" by Alfred Ainger is a biographical examination of the life and works of the poet George Crabbe, written in the early 20th century. The book explores Crabbe's life from his humble beginnings in Aldeburgh through his struggles in London to his eventual recognition as a poet. It delves into themes of social realism and poetry's relationship with human compassion, alongside Crabbe's influences and literary contemporaries.  The opening of this volume provides an overview of Crabbe's early life, revealing his formative years marked by hardship and a growing love for literature. It discusses his family's impoverished conditions, his education, and early aspirations to become a physician, which ultimately shifted towards writing. The narrative paints a vivid picture of his upbringing—describing a decaying seaport town—and the socio-economic challenges Crabbe faced. It highlights key influences in his life, such as his family's efforts to cultivate his literary talents and the connections he made that would later support his entrance into the literary world. The text sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Crabbe's poetry, particularly his portrayal of the struggles and realities of the poor, positioning him within the broader context of 18th-century English literature.
