    "resumo": "\"GROWTH OF THE SOIL\" by Knut Hamsun is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book explores themes of nature, solitude, and the human condition through the journey of the main character, Isak, a simple, hardworking man who seeks to create a life for himself in the wilderness of Norway.   At the start of the story, Isak embarks on a solitary journey across a vast, untouched landscape, eventually settling on a piece of land that he intends to cultivate. He carries with him basic supplies and a strong determination to embrace self-sufficiency and a connection to the land. As he begins to build a life there, he explores the surrounding area, recognizes its potential for farming, and establishes routines that signify his deepening relationship with the soil. Hamsun's prose vividly evokes the contrast between the harshness of nature and Isak's quiet resilience, setting the stage for further developments in his character and the life he hopes to create.
