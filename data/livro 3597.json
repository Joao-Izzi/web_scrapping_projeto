    "resumo": "\"The Pearl of Lima: A Story of True Love\" by Jules Verne is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story is set against a backdrop of social tension in Lima, Peru, focusing on the lives of various characters, including the wealthy mestizo André Certa and the beautiful Jewess Sarah, who is betrothed to Certa but has feelings for the Indian Martin Paz. The narrative intertwines themes of love, social inequality, and the struggles between different ethnic groups in a changing society.  The opening of the novel introduces us to the vibrant and tumultuous atmosphere of Lima's Plaza-Mayor as evening descends. We meet André Certa, who is resentful of the social hierarchies that dictate his life, and his companions who display a mixture of envy and desire for status. A pivotal moment occurs when Certa encounters Martin Paz, an Indian who defends a young girl named Sarah from a brutish attacker, setting the stage for a conflict filled with passion and political upheaval. As tensions simmer between the mestizoes and the Indians, the characters are drawn into a complex web of love, rivalry, and rebellion that promises to shape their fates.
