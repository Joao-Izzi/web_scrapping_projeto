    "resumo": "\"De Officiis\" by Marcus Tullius Cicero is a philosophical treatise written in the 1st century BC. The work focuses on ethical principles, particularly moral duties and their applications in public and private life. Cicero, addressing his son Marcus, draws on Greek philosophy to present a practical guide to ethical behaviorâ€”essentially outlining the obligations one has towards oneself and society.  The opening of \"De Officiis\" establishes the context for this ethical exploration as Cicero writes to his son, who is studying in Athens. He emphasizes the importance of combining Greek and Latin studies for a comprehensive understanding of philosophy and oratory. Cicero then discusses the practical importance of moral duties, asserting that these obligations are ubiquitous in life and form the foundation of moral goodness. He highlights the differences between absolute duties and those dependent on situations, introducing the philosophical frameworks he will build upon throughout the treatise, primarily drawing on Stoic thought.
