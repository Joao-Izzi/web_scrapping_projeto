    "resumo": "\"How old are fossils?\" by Sharat Kumar Roy is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century, specifically in 1927. The book operates as a geology leaflet aimed at museum visitors and general readers interested in paleontology, focusing on the methods of determining the age of fossils and ancient life forms. Its purpose is to provide a clear and concise understanding of this complex topic without requiring exhaustive academic study.  The content of the book introduces readers to the methods used by geologists and paleontologists for estimating the age of fossils and the strata they are found in. Roy discusses the evolution of thought regarding geological time, contrasting historical beliefs with modern scientific understanding. He outlines traditional methods such as sedimentation rate and salt accumulation, while emphasizing the impact of the groundbreaking study of radioactivity on determining geological time with more accuracy. Throughout the text, Roy navigates the intricacies of paleontological evidence, the uniformity of rates in nature, and the complex relationship between evolution and geological eras, ultimately revealing that life on Earth is far older than many commonly believed estimates.
