    "resumo": "\"If at First You Don't...\" by John Brudy is a satirical science fiction novella likely written in the early 21st century. The book focuses on the bureaucratic and absurd challenges surrounding the fate of the satellite '58 Beta, which becomes a symbol of pride and contention among various stakeholders in the U.S. government and public. It delves into themes of nostalgia, historical significance, and the often comical nature of administrative decision-making in the face of trivial yet heated debates.  The story follows Amos Jordan, the Secretary for Cislunar Navigation, as he is drawn into a chaotic political fracas regarding the fate of the aging satellite '58 Beta, which is on a collision course with the Earth's atmosphere. The narrative unfolds through Jordan's interactions with his assistant, Clements, and various political figures, including the obstinate Senator Darius, who insists on preserving Beta as a tribute to early space exploration. As public sentiment rises, leading to student riots and congressional debates, Jordan grapples with the absurdity of the situation, ultimately leveraging a little-known regulation to classify Beta as dangerous debris, allowing it to be decommissioned without further fuss. The finale humorously twists into a bureaucratic triumph with the successful re-launching of '58 Beta after taking into account numerous administrative mishaps, culminating in a reflection on the cyclical nature of power and historical preservation in a spacefaring age.
