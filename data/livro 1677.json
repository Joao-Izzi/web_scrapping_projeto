The opening of the book introduces a detailed examination of the aristocratic magistracies in Venice at the beginning of the sixteenth century. It describes the flexible yet rigid nature of the Venetian government, emphasizing its long-standing aristocratic form and the intricate checks imposed to prevent any individual from gaining too much power, especially the Doge. The narrative then transitions to various historical anecdotes showcasing the complex interplay between law and social order, including the mystique surrounding notorious criminals known as \"bravi\" and the severe penalties imposed for crimes, ultimately setting the stage for a deeper investigation into Venetian society, governance, and its eventual decline.
