    "resumo": "\"La Tosca: Drama trágico en cuatro actos divididos en cinco cuadros\" by Sardou is a dramatic play written in the late 19th century. The story is set in Rome during the year 1800, during a time of political turmoil and conflict. The central characters include Floria Tosca, a passionate opera singer, and Mario Cavaradossi, her artist lover, who finds himself embroiled in revolutionary activities that could lead to dire consequences.  The opening of the play introduces us to the Church of San Andrés in Quirinal, where we meet characters like Padre Eusebio and Genarino, who reveal a sense of tension and foreboding about the political climate. Mario Cavaradossi is preparing to paint in the church while trying to evade the eyes of the authorities. The arrival of César Angelotti, a fugitive seeking refuge, sets the stage for the conflict, as he reveals his desperate circumstances, invoking a brotherhood with Mario. Throughout this initial setting, hints of jealousy, love, and the dangers of political allegiances are conveyed, promising a gripping exploration of personal and political stakes as the drama unfolds.
