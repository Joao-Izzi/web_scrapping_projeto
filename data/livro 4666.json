    "resumo": "\"The Ocean Wireless Boys of the Iceberg Patrol\" by Captain Wilbur Lawton is a children's adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows young Jack Ready, a wireless operator aboard the freighter \"Cambodian\", as he navigates the dangers of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly the threat posed by icebergs. Alongside his friend Billy Raynor, Jack grapples with the challenges of his profession while facing adversity from a reckless captain and the unpredictability of the sea.  At the start of the novel, Jack is adjusting to his role in the wireless room of the \"Cambodian\", where he is optimistic despite being passed over for a position on a larger liner. He and Raynor discuss the dangers ahead as they receive iceberg reports from other ships, signaling an acute sense of tension as the temperature drops and conditions worsen. Shortly after, Jack realizes that Captain Briggs, who is under the influence of alcohol, is steering the ship recklessly toward icebergs. This alarming situation culminates when Billy Raynor falls overboard after an encounter with an iceberg, prompting Jack's desperate efforts to alert the crew and seek his friend's rescue, setting the stage for a series of dramatic events that unfold in the novel.
