    "resumo": "\"Tres Comedias Modernas\" by Barranco, Cocat, Criado y Baca, and Ramos Carrión is a collection of modern Spanish comedies written in the early 20th century. This compilation features three distinct plays, \"La Muela del Juicio,\" \"Las Solteronas,\" and \"Los Pantalones,\" showcasing the humor, societal themes, and character interactions prevalent in contemporary Spain. The works are likely to engage readers interested in witty dramas that reflect on everyday life and human relationships.  The opening of \"La Muela del Juicio\" introduces the character Raigón, a dentist who is frustrated with his careless assistant, Francisco. The scene is set in a luxurious dental office, emphasizing the comedic dynamics between the overbearing dentist and his slacker employee. After a back-and-forth reprimand, we meet Don Atilano, who desperately needs Raigón's help for his daughter’s painful toothache but finds Raigón unapproachable. This portion sets the stage for the ensuing comedic complications and misunderstandings about dental woes and personal struggles, hinting at the play's lighthearted take on societal issues and class interactions.
