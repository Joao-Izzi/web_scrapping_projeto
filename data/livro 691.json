    "resumo": "\"In the Catskills: Selections from the Writings of John Burroughs\" by John Burroughs is a collection of nature essays written in the early 20th century. The book reflects Burroughs's deep affection for the Catskill region, where he spent his formative years. Through prose that evokes both a sense of wonder and nostalgia, he explores themes related to the natural world, seasonal changes, and rural life, capturing the essence of the landscape and its wildlife.  The opening of this collection introduces the significance of winter in the Catskills and how it transforms the environment into a realm of beauty and simplicity. Burroughs discusses the starkness of winter and how it influences human perception, enhancing clarity and focus. He describes the serenity of a snow-covered landscape, emphasizing the patterns made by animals like the red fox and the variety of tracks that tell the stories of different creatures. Throughout the passage, he skillfully observes the interactions between nature and its inhabitants, illustrating not only the beauty of the natural world but also the profound connection that humans can foster with it.
