    "resumo": "\"Country Life in the Poetry of John Clare\" by Mildred M. Coen is a scholarly thesis written in the early 20th century. This work explores the intersection of John Clare's peasant background with the themes of rural life reflected in his poetry. Coen analyzes Clare's experiences against the backdrop of significant economic changes in England during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, specifically the agrarian revolutions that affected the peasant class.  The thesis is divided into three main parts: the economic conditions of Clare's era, a biographical sketch of the poet's life, and an examination of the themes in his poetry. Clare's works are categorized into love poems, nature poems, and social life poems, each capturing the emotional and aesthetic essence of rural existence despite the poet's material hardships. Coen illustrates how Clare's poetry, rather than serving a propagandistic function, seeks to express beauty and tenderness found within the struggles of country life, emphasizing the role of nature and love in providing solace amid poverty and social upheaval. Through detailed analyses of Clareâ€™s verses, Coen reveals the rich poetic observations of Clare's experiences and sentiments as a rural laborer, painting a multifaceted portrait of country life during a time of transition.
