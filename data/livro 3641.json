    "resumo": "\"Maritime Enterprise, 1485-1558\" by James A. Williamson is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book delves into the maritime history of England during a pivotal transitional period, focusing on exploration and trade from the reign of Henry VII to that of Elizabeth I. It aims to illuminate the developing maritime policies and the rise of English commercial power at a time when the country was evolving from military ambitions to becoming a formidable naval and trading nation.  The opening of the work introduces the dual focus of English maritime endeavorsâ€”discovery and trade. Williamson discusses the existing historiography surrounding important voyages, notably those of the Cabots, while identifying gaps in the commercial history that warrant further exploration. He emphasizes the transformative role of England's maritime expansion and the implications of such policies for English trade during the Tudor period, setting the groundwork for a detailed examination of the political and economic forces that shaped England's maritime strategies in the 15th and 16th centuries.
