    "resumo": "\"Het portret van Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is a novel written during the late 19th century.\" The story revolves around the character Dorian Gray, a remarkably beautiful young man whose portrait is painted by the artist Basil Hallward. The themes of vanity, morality, and the nature of beauty are explored as Dorian becomes entranced by a life of excess and hedonism after encountering Lord Henry Wotton, a character who espouses a philosophy of indulgence without regard for consequence.  \"The opening of the novel sets a lush, atmospheric scene in the artist's studio, filled with the fragrance of roses and lilacs.\" We are introduced to Basil Hallward, who is preoccupied with the portrait of Dorian Gray, which he believes to be his finest work. Lord Henry Wotton, another key character, engages Basil in conversation, expressing curiosity about Dorian, whom Basil has not yet revealed to him. As the dialogue unfolds, Lord Henry's hedonistic worldview starkly contrasts with Basil's protective feelings for Dorian, creating an undercurrent of tension. The stage is set for Dorian's eventual introduction, which will lead to profound transformations in his character and life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
