    "resumo": "\"Mr. Durant of Salt Lake City, 'That Mormon'\" by Ben E. Rich is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work aims to present the faith and beliefs of the Latter-day Saints, highlighting the experiences of Charles Durant, a Western missionary from Salt Lake City, as he engages with various characters in a Southern town. The book provides an exploration of religious discussions and the challenges faced by Durant in advocating for his beliefs amidst skepticism and prejudice.   At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to a bustling Southern town, Westminster, where the scenery and customs reflect the societal changes post-Civil War. The opening chapters set the stage for the arrival of Charles Durant, who becomes a part of the Marshall familyâ€™s social circle. His ability to relate and engage in deep discussions about faith and morality captures the interest of the townsfolk, leading to a series of dialogues among guests at the Harmony Place hotel. As Durant navigates these interactions, we witness a clash of ideas surrounding Christianity and its interpretations, ultimately revealing his mission to present the principles of his faith to an interested audience, despite facing hostility from some local figures, particularly a disapproving minister.
