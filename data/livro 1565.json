    "resumo": "\"An Elegy on the Glory of Her Sex, Mrs. Mary Blaize\" by Oliver Goldsmith is a poem that falls within the genre of humorous verse, likely written in the 18th century. The work reflects on the life and character of the fictional Mrs. Mary Blaize, exploring themes of vanity, societal norms, and the human condition. The poem employs a light-hearted tone to convey deeper social commentary, characteristic of Goldsmith's literary style.  The poem narrates the story of Mrs. Mary Blaize, a woman known for her wealth, beauty, and charm, as well as her shortcomings and follies. It begins by lamenting her passing, describing her generous nature towards the poor and how she was admired by many, including the King. However, the narrative takes a satirical turn as it hints at her moral flaws and vanity, such as her ostentatious church attire and the competition for her affections among suitors. Ultimately, the elegy highlights the fleeting nature of beauty and wealth, suggesting that despite her social prowess, it was her inability to escape reality that led to her downfall. The poem invites readers to reflect on the paradoxes of human behavior, especially in the context of social stature and personal morality. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
