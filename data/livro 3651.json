    "resumo": "\"At the Earth's Core\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a science fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows David Innes, a young man who embarks on a remarkable journey to the hollow center of the Earth, where he encounters strange creatures and civilizations, including his friend Abner Perry, who plays a crucial role in their adventurous descent. The narrative explores themes of exploration and survival in an uncharted world filled with prehistoric beasts and unknown dangers.  The opening of the book introduces us to David Innes and hints at his extraordinary experiences, beginning with a discussion of a mechanical device designed for underground exploration. Innes recalls his journey's inception with Perry, the inventor of a groundbreaking “iron mole,” which catapults them into the depths of the Earth. After a harrowing descent, they emerge in a vibrant yet perilous inner world filled with bizarre creatures such as bear-like monsters and primitive humanoids known as Sagoths. The initial excitement quickly turns to danger as both characters are captured, setting the stage for an epic struggle for survival amid the wonders and horrors of the inner realm.
