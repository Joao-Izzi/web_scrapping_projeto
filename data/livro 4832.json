    "resumo": "\"King Candaules\" by Théophile Gautier is a historical novella written in the late 19th century. Set in ancient Lydia before the Trojan War, the story revolves around the exploits of King Candaules and his obsession with displaying the beauty of his wife, Queen Nyssia. The narrative explores themes of desire, jealousy, and the boundaries of intimacy as Candaules devises a plan that fundamentally alters the dynamics of love and honor.  The opening of the tale establishes the atmosphere of anticipation surrounding a grand festival in Sardes, where Candaules is set to marry Nyssia, the daughter of a satrap. As the festivities unfold, we are introduced to Gyges, the king's chief guard, whose life becomes enmeshed in the intrigue of the royal family. Candaules, captivated by Nyssia's beauty, recounts her unmatched allure to Gyges and eventually reveals his desire to show her to him in a moment of intimacy. As Gyges grapples with the moral implications of witnessing Nyssia's nudity, the narrative heightens its tension, foreshadowing conflict and the complex interplay of admiration, possession, and betrayal that will follow.
