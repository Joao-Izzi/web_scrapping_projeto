    "resumo": "\"Roumania Past and Present\" by James Samuelson is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book provides a detailed exploration of Roumania's geography, economy, societal structures, and historical significance, particularly focusing on its position between Russia and Turkey during a time of political change. Samuelson aims to illuminate the country’s past and present to a largely uninformed English audience.  At the start of the work, the author highlights the general ignorance surrounding Roumania among Englishmen, illustrating this point with anecdotes about misdirected correspondence and inaccurate perceptions of its geographical location. He expresses a keen interest in both the contemporary state of the nation and its historical context, explaining that he was compelled to undertake research and travel within Roumania for a deeper understanding. The opening chapters lay the groundwork for a comprehensive examination of the country’s geographical features, social dynamics, and political importance, while also addressing the issues impacting the peasantry, land ownership reform, and the navigation of the Danube River, all of which are critical topics for understanding Roumania's place in European affairs at the time.
