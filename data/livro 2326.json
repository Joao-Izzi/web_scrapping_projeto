    "resumo": "\"The Water-Babies\" by Charles Kingsley is a children's novel written during the late 19th century. The book follows the adventures of Tom, a young chimney-sweep who encounters various fantastical elements and moral lessons after he is transformed into a \"water-baby.\" The story explores themes of innocence, growth, and the beauty of nature, serving not only as a fairy tale for young readers but also as a commentary on the social conditions of the time.  The opening of the novel introduces Tom, a poor chimney-sweep living in the North of England, whose life is filled with hardship and neglect. Through vivid descriptions, the text paints a picture of his struggles, including the physical labor he endures and his lack of education and parental guidance. One day, Tom encounters an Irishwoman who offers him a glimpse of kindness. After an altercation with his cruel master, Tom embarks on a journey that leads him to a magical spring, where he finds himself longing for cleanliness and purity. This desire culminates in his dramatic transformation into a water-baby, a pivotal moment that sets the stage for his adventures in the water and eventual quest for self-discovery.
