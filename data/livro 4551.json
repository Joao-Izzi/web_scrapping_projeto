    "resumo": "\"The History of Christianity\" by John S. C. Abbott is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, the adventures of Paul and the apostles, and significant events in the development of Christianity from its inception to modern times. It seeks to engage readers who may not possess a theological background but are interested in the profound impact of Christianity on human history.  The opening of the book sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the historical context surrounding the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Abbott describes the political and social climate of the Roman Empire at the time, introducing the reader to key biblical events leading up to and following Jesus' birth, such as the Annunciation to Mary, the visit of the Magi, and the subsequent flight to Egypt. Abbott emphasizes the significance of Jesusâ€™ humble beginnings, positioning his life within the broader narrative of historical empire and human struggle. This introduction serves as a prelude to discussing not just Jesus' life, but also the principles of Christianity that would emerge and grow, shaping civilizations as they evolved.
