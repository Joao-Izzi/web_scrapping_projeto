    "resumo": "\"The House of Torchy\" by Sewell Ford is a humorous novel written in the early 20th century. The book follows the misadventures of Richard T. Ballard, known as Torchy, who is newly married to Verona (Vee). Their journey is depicted as they navigate the complexities of marriage, adjusting to their new life together, and encountering unique characters along the way.  The opening of the novel introduces Torchy and Vee as they arrive at a quaint inn in Vermont for their honeymoon. Torchy shares his humorous observations about their marriage and the inevitably awkward moments they experience. As they settle in, Torchy attempts to engage with the other guests, only to feel like an outsider amidst their refined conversations. Vee, however, remains cheerful, expressing her eagerness to enjoy their time together, bringing lightheartedness to their situation. The dynamics of their relationship and Torchy's witty narration set the stage for an entertaining exploration of their new life as a married couple. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
