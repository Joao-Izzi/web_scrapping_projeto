    "resumo": "\"The Works of Francis Maitland Balfour, Volume 3\" is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This volume completes Balfour's comprehensive treatise on Comparative Embryology, with a specific focus on the developmental history of Chordata, including detailed descriptions of various subgroups such as Cephalochorda, Urochorda, and Vertebrata. The text likely explores the intricate processes of organ development and embryonic structures, reflecting Balfour's contributions to the field of zoology and his extensive laboratory investigations.  At the start of this volume, Balfour presents the foundational concepts of embryological development within Chordata, laying out an overview of the three main divisions in this classification. He introduces the structure and developmental characteristics of the Cephalochorda, using the example of Amphioxus to illustrate segmentation, invagination, and the formation of critical systems such as the central nervous system and notochord. The initial chapters discuss the stages of development, focusing on the organization of embryonic layers, which are crucial for understanding later developments in various vertebrate forms.
