    "resumo": "\"My Austrian Love\" by Maxime Provost is a semi-autobiographical novel likely written in the early 20th century, during or just after the First World War. The narrative follows the experiences of Patrick Cooper, an English composer, as he navigates his connections and encounters in Vienna, particularly revolving around his admiration for a young lady he refers to as his \"Austrian love,\" as well as his artistic pursuits amidst the backdrop of war.   At the start of the novel, the protagonist is taking a train from Munich to Vienna, reflecting on the beauty of Salzburg and his past experiences during the journey. We are introduced to a rather irascible Frenchman in his carriage who creates a disturbance over customs regulations, which serves as a catalyst for Cooper's thoughts. Once the train continues, he finds himself alone with a young lady, who immediately captures his attention with her charm and beauty. Their initial interaction is marked by his shyness and curiosity about her background, which becomes a mystery as the narrative unfolds, indicating a budding romance amid tumultuous external circumstances. The opening paints a vivid picture of anticipation, with hints of comedic misunderstandings and romantic tension as Cooper reminisces about a past encounter with the young lady, setting a humorous and warm tone for the unfolding love story.
