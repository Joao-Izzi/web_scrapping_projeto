    "resumo": "\"Crito\" by Plato is a philosophical dialogue written during the late 4th century BC. The book features a conversation between Socrates and his friend Crito, primarily discussing themes of justice, duty, and the social contract. It serves as a critique of Socrates' decision to accept his death sentence rather than escape from prison, prompting reflections on personal ethics vs. societal laws.  In this dialogue set in Socrates' prison cell, Crito visits Socrates with a plan for his escape, urging him to flee and avoid execution. Crito argues from emotional and social perspectives, worrying about the disgrace that will fall upon him if he does not help Socrates. However, Socrates counters with philosophical reasoning, emphasizing that one should never do wrong, even in response to wrongdoing. He explores the nature of justice, the obligation to the laws of the state, and the consequences of escaping prison. Ultimately, Socrates concludes that it is unjust to flee, as doing so would undermine the principles he has long upheld. This dialogue highlights the conflict between individual morality and the laws of society, illustrating Socrates' commitment to his ideals even in the face of death.
