    "resumo": "\"Doña Luz\" by Juan Valera is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story presents the life of Doña Luz, a young woman in a rural Spanish town, who grapples with societal expectations and her own desires for autonomy and purity. The novel delves into themes of love, identity, and the tensions between social class and personal integrity.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Doña Luz, who is portrayed as a strikingly beautiful and morally upright young woman, living in the care of D. Acisclo, a once-loyal administrator to her deceased father, the Marqués. Following her father's death, she struggles with her identity as a legitimate daughter of a nobleman while navigating the expectations of marriage and the pressure from suitors, none of whom appeal to her. The narrative sets the stage by exploring Doña Luz's relationships with the people around her, highlighting her pride and the complexities of her character, as well as her aspirations for a life untainted by the ordinary expectations of marriage. Through her interactions with various male figures and her refusal to conform to societal norms, the opening lays the groundwork for a story of self-discovery and moral conflict.
