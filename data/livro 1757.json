    "resumo": "\"Divinity\" by William Morrison is a science fiction novel likely written in the early to mid-20th century. The story explores themes of identity, power, and personal transformation through the unexpected journey of its protagonist, Bradley, who finds himself mistaken for a god by an alien civilization after fleeing from his past as a petty criminal on Earth. The narrative reflects upon the complexities of self-worth and the inherent responsibilities that come with power.  The plot centers around Bradley's dramatic escape from a spaceship, which leads him accidentally to an alien planet. Initially reveling in the elevated status granted to him by the natives, he capitalizes on their beliefs, donning a helmet and maintaining his guise as a deity. The story unfolds as he grapples with the contrast between his past cowardice and the newfound responsibility he feels towards the alien people. Problems arise when he has to confront both external threats, such as dangerous creatures, and internal struggles, including his attraction to a native woman and the fear of being exposed. Ultimately, as he evolves from a reluctant fugitive to a capable leader, he discovers the value of personal growth and acceptance of his own identity, culminating in a final twist where he embraces the journey to regeneration.
