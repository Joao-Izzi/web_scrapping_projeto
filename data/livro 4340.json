    "resumo": "\"Volvoreta\" by Wenceslao Fernández-Flórez is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story captures themes of class dynamics, love, and the simplicity of rural life, revolving around the experiences of the young protagonist, Federica, a servant nicknamed \"Volvoreta,\" and her interactions with her employer's family, particularly the young man, Sergio.   The opening of the novel introduces us to the main character, Federica, as she enters a new household to work as a servant. She is met with suspicion by doña Rosa, the mistress of the house, who disapproves of her name and background, indicating class differences. As Federica settles into her role, we see glimpses of her interactions with the family, including a budding connection with Sergio, who is depicted as a somewhat romantic and naive young man navigating his feelings for her amidst the constraints of their social positions. The author sets the stage for a tale interconnected with various characters and their complexities, hinting at deeper themes of societal expectations and emotional entanglements.
