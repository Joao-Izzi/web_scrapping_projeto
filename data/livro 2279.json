    "resumo": "\"Heroes in Peace\" by John Haynes Holmes is a philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century, specifically in the aftermath of World War I. The book serves as the sixth lecture in the William Penn Lecture series and discusses the concept of heroism, challenging the traditional identification of heroes solely as soldiers. It explores the idea that true heroism can and does exist outside of the battlefield, emphasizing the heroism found in everyday life, the struggles of peacemakers, and the sacrifices made by individuals who toil for the greater good without the recognition afforded to military heroes.  In \"Heroes in Peace,\" Holmes argues that while soldiers demonstrate notable courage, a more profound and selfless form of heroism is present in the mundane acts of valor performed by ordinary people. Through various examples, including acts of sacrifice in daily life and the struggles faced by pioneers and individuals in solitary circumstances, he illustrates that true heroism is often unsung and unrecognized. The text critiques the glorification of war and the soldiers while promoting a broader understanding of what it means to be a hero, culminating in a powerful call to recognize and honor those who act out of moral conviction and altruism in times of peace.
