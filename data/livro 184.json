    "resumo": "\"Ancient America, in Notes on American Archaeology\" by John D. Baldwin is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the various archaeological remains of ancient civilizations in America, notably the Mound-Builders of the Mississippi Valley, as well as cultures from Mexico and Central America. It aims to provide a comprehensive summary of known American antiquities and their significance while comparing them to other ancient civilizations.  The opening of the work introduces the subject matter by highlighting the need for a general understanding of American archaeology, which Baldwin notes is sparse in existing literary form. He emphasizes that the Mound-Builders, an ancient and unidentified people, left a significant number of mounds and structures that reflect a settled and organized society with some degree of civilization. Baldwin outlines similarities between these constructions and those found in Mexico, suggesting a shared cultural heritage, while also referencing the work of earlier scholars such as Squier and Davis, who have explored these intriguing remnants of the past. Overall, the beginning of the book sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the lives and advancements of ancient peoples in America. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
