    "resumo": "\"Money (L'Argent)\" by Émile Zola is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the character of Saccard, a scheming financier whose passion for wealth and power leads him into the murky depths of speculation and corruption as he attempts to regain his former status in the financial world. The book explores themes of greed, ambition, and the socio-economic issues present in the rapidly changing society of Paris during that era.  The opening of the novel introduces Saccard as he enters a bustling restaurant near the Bourse, filled with speculators and brokers engaged in a high-stakes game of finance. Initially, he is met with indifference and coldness from those who once revered him, emphasizing his current status as a fallen figure in the world of finance. As he waits for a colleague with news on a crucial financial application, his thoughts reveal a mixture of desperation and ambition, indicating his desire to resurrect his career through daring ventures, while contemplating the broader social context of speculative ethics and mob mentality symptomatic of financial markets. Zola sets the stage for a riveting exploration of the destructive power of money, set against the backdrop of a society grappling with its moral compass.
