    "resumo": "\"Harry Escombe: A Tale of Adventure in Peru\" by Harry Collingwood is a fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Harry Escombe, a young apprentice civil engineer who is selected to assist in the survey and construction of a railway line in Peru. As the narrative unfolds, readers can anticipate a journey filled with exploration, danger, and personal growth.  The opening portion of the tale introduces Harry as he receives the exciting opportunity to work in Peru, a prospect loaded with hope for a better future for his struggling family. However, the thrill of adventure is soon overshadowed by the reality of working under Mr. Butler, his tyrannical superior, who subjects him to strenuous and unsafe tasks. After a precarious accident during surveying, Harry finds himself plunged into a life-threatening situation, only to be rescued by a local Indian woman and her son. As he recuperates in their care, the stage is set for further revelations about his journey, the culture surrounding him, and the ongoing challenges he faces on the road ahead.
