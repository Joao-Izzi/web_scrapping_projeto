    "resumo": "\"The Battle of Principles\" by Newell Dwight Hillis is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the moral and intellectual battles surrounding the Anti-Slavery movement in America, examining the key figures and events that shaped this significant period in U.S. history. It likely offers insights into how the eloquence and heroism of individuals fighting against slavery laid the foundation for modern democratic values and social justice.  The opening of the book sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the rise of American slavery, emphasizing its economic and moral implications. It argues that the Civil War, sparked by the fundamental contradictions between liberty and slavery, was vital in defining the nation. Hillis outlines the growth of the abolitionist sentiment, highlighting the political debates, significant events, and notable figures such as Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, ultimately framing the Anti-Slavery conflict as a battle not only for human rights but also for the very essence of American democracy. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
