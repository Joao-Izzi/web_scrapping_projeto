    "resumo": "\"Poppy's Presents\" by Mrs. O. F. Walton is a children's novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Poppy, a gentle and caring young girl who unexpectedly receives two babies as a \"present\" from God after her father leaves the family and her mother struggles to make ends meet. The narrative explores themes of responsibility, love, and the challenges of growing up in a difficult environment.  At the start of the story, we are introduced to Poppy as a schoolgirl eagerly waiting for classes to end and rushing home, her red cloak a vivid detail in the bustling city setting. Poppy navigates through a tight-knit community where her mother's wisdom, care, and the neighborsâ€™ support play vital roles in her life. When Poppy learns of her mother's new \"presents,\" twin babies, her initial joy contrasts with the heavy burdens placed on her young shoulders as she quickly assumes the responsibilities of an unexpected caretaker. This opening sets the stage for Poppy's journey of love and sacrifice, providing readers with an emotional glimpse into her life as she adapts to her circumstances while cherishing her new family.
