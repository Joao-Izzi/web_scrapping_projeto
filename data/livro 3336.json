    "resumo": "\"As Farpas: Chronica Mensal da Politica, das Letras e dos Costumes\" by Ramalho Ortigão and Eça de Queiroz is a collection of essays and articles written in the late 19th century. The work critiques contemporary political, literary, and social issues in Portugal, particularly focusing on the influence of prominent figures like Alexandre Herculano. The authors employ irony and satire to address the corruption and mediocrity in politics and society, providing insightful commentary on the literary scene and the condition of women’s education.  The opening of the text highlights the dual legacy of Alexandre Herculano, celebrating his contributions to Portuguese literature and history while lamenting his later retreat into solitude. The narrative articulates a sense of loss over a significant intellectual voice that could have shaped national consciousness, suggesting that his withdrawal had grave implications for Portuguese society. The authors urge a deeper examination of Herculano's life and influence, setting the stage for a series of analyses that intertwine personal reflections with broader societal critiques throughout the work.
