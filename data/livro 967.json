    "resumo": "\"Notre-Dame de Paris - Tome 2\" by Victor Hugo is a historical novel written in the early 19th century. The narrative centers around the iconic Gothic cathedral of Notre-Dame, weaving intricate tales of its inhabitants, particularly exploring themes of love, jealousy, and social tensions through characters such as the beautiful Gypsy dancer Esmeralda and the conflicted archdeacon Claude Frollo.   The opening of this volume introduces a scene in early March, as Paris basks in the warmth of a spring day. A group of noble young ladies gathers on a balcony overlooking Notre-Dame, eagerly anticipating a visit from the royal family. Among them is Fleur-de-Lys, who is engaged to the captain Ph≈ìbus, yet the arrival of the enchanting Esmeralda ignites both rivalry and admiration among the ladies. As tensions rise with the presence of this beautiful Gypsy dancer, Claude Frollo, the archdeacon, watches her intently from the tower, signaling the impending drama that will intertwine their lives in unexpected ways. The narrative juxtaposes the joy of innocent youth with the darker undercurrents of passion and desperation, setting a poignant tone for the unfolding story.
