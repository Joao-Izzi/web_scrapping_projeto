    "resumo": "\"The Works of Lord Byron. Vol. 3\" by Baron George Gordon Byron is a collection of poetry written in the early 19th century. This volume includes several metrical tales composed between 1812 and 1815, along with the \"Hebrew Melodies\" and various minor poems from 1809 to 1816. The collection reflects the height of Byron's popularity as a poet, showcasing his distinctive style that combines elements of romance, adventure, and personal reflection.  The opening of this volume features a preface by editor Ernest Hartley Coleridge, who emphasizes Byron's meteoric rise to fame and the impact of his tales, such as \"The Giaour\" and \"The Bride of Abydos\". Coleridge notes that while these works once captivated audiences, contemporary readers may overlook them due to changing tastes and literary standards. The introduction sets the stage for the poems that follow, which explore themes of love, loss, and the exoticism of the Turkish and Eastern settings prevalent in Byron's works, thereby inviting readers into the enchanting world crafted by one of the most celebrated poets of his time.
