    "resumo": "\"The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended\" by Sir Isaac Newton is a historical account written in the early 18th century. This work focuses on the chronological history of various ancient kingdoms, refining and correcting the timelines established by earlier historians. The book delves into the lineage and reigns of notable kings and civilizations, including the Greeks, Egyptians, Assyrians, and others, as it aims to clarify the ambiguities surrounding their historical timelines.  At the start of the text, Newton presents a preface, acknowledging the work done in the historical study to Her Majesty and expressing admiration for the late author's intellect and contributions. This portion also includes an introduction to the content, examining the confusion and contradictions in the ancient chronological accounts, especially those from Greek and Roman sources. Newton seems to set the stage for a detailed exploration by cataloging significant events and rulers, ultimately providing a deeper understanding of the history and chronology that predates and influences the known histories of Europe and the Mediterranean region.
