    "resumo": "\"Black Treasure\" by Roger Barlow is a children's adventure novel written in the mid-20th century. The story follows Sandy Steele and his friend Quiz Taylor, two high school students who have entered a science fair. Their invention—a geological analyzer—captures the attention of John Hall, an oil wildcat operator, leading to a summer job opportunity for the boys that involves learning about oil drilling in the Four Corners region, which includes their journey among Native American lands and cultures.  The opening of the book sets the stage during the Regional Science Fair in Poplar City, California, where Sandy and Quiz feel disheartened after receiving only an honorable mention for their project, in contrast to the flashy exhibit of their rival, Pepper March. Their fortunes change when John Hall approaches them, intrigued by their work and eager to recruit them for an oil drilling operation. The narrative captures their initial excitement and trepidation as they accept the job, leading to encounters with various characters, including Native Americans and rival prospectors, setting off a summer filled with adventure and the challenges of navigating a complex adult world.
