    "resumo": "\"The Sequel\" by George A. Taylor is a novel written in the early 20th century, specifically in the context of World War I. The book presents the narrative of Lieutenant Jefson, an aviator who finds himself entwined in the tumult of battle while grappling with his previously held beliefs about peace and militarism. The story is set against the backdrop of a war that challenges ideals and forces characters to confront the harsh realities of conflict, while also depicting the technological advancements in aviation during the time.  The opening of the book introduces readers to Lieutenant Jefson on the day he is shot down while flying over the Argonne Forest in February 1915. As he recovers in a German hospital, he reflects on his past opposition to war, having once been a member of a Peace Society. This internal conflict sets the stage for Jefson's transformation from a peace advocate to a soldier, compelled to defend civilization against aggression. The narrative explores his thoughts on the folly of pursuing peace at the expense of national preparedness, ultimately leading him to embrace his role in the war. This introspective beginning hints at a deeper commentary on the moral ambiguities of conflict and the journey of a character navigating the complexities of loyalty, duty, and personal ideology amid the chaos of war.
