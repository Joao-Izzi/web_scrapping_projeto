    "resumo": "\"Antikristuksen ihmetyöt\" by Selma Lagerlöf is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story explores profound themes of faith, prophecy, and the duality of good and evil through allegorical and mythological elements. Central to the narrative is the prophetic figure of the Sibyl, set against the historical backdrop of Augustus’s Rome, who reveals her foreboding message regarding the arrival of Antichrist.  At the start of the novel, a dense darkness envelops the land during a significant night, while Emperor Augustus considers a sacred offering to the gods. As he and his entourage prepare to conduct a nighttime ritual, they encounter a horrifying Sibyl, who alludes to the coming of Antichrist, resembling Christ but destined to deceive. The opening sets a tone of tension and mystery, introducing elements of prophecy and tension between divine forces and human perception, ultimately revealing the Sibyl’s foretelling of a humble child who will transform the world. This blend of myth, spirituality, and history hints at a deeper exploration of faith and redemption that goes beyond the characters' immediate experiences.
