    "resumo": "\"Le marchand de Venise\" by William Shakespeare is a play written in the late 16th century. The narrative revolves around complex themes such as love, mercy, and revenge, primarily focusing on the relationships among Antonio, a melancholic merchant; Bassanio, his close friend who seeks the hand of the wealthy Portia; and Shylock, the Jewish moneylender. The interplay between these characters sets the stage for various comedic and dramatic incidents throughout the drama.  The opening of the play introduces Antonio, who is inexplicably sad, though he dismisses the notion that his melancholy is due to his fortunes at sea. His friends, Salarino and Salanio, speculate about his mood, attributing it to his shipping ventures. They are interrupted by the arrival of Bassanio, who reveals his desire to court Portia, a wealthy heiress. However, he needs money to present himself as a worthy suitor, prompting him to ask Antonio for help. The act ends with the introduction of Shylock, who is keenly aware of the tensions and hostilities existing between the Christian merchant Antonio and himself, setting the stage for the central conflict of the play.
