    "resumo": "\"Double Dealing\" by W. W. Jacobs is a humorous short story written in the early 20th century. It follows the misadventures of Mr. Fred Carter, who finds himself mistaken for another man, Bert Simmons, and gets unintentionally tangled in a complicated romantic scenario. The story explores themes of identity, mistaken intentions, and the chaos that often ensues from misunderstandings.  The plot unfolds as Mr. Carter is confronted by the angry father and brother of Miss Nancy Evans, who believe he is Bert, the man who left for London after promising to marry her. As they drag him back to their home, Mr. Carter cleverly attempts to navigate the situation to his advantage, although he finds himself at the mercy of the family's expectations. Throughout the story, the mix of comic relief and tension builds up as Mr. Carter tries to convince everyone of his true identity while grappling with his unexpected role in the lives of Miss Evans and her family. The narrative takes a turn when various acquaintances of the real Bert appear, further complicating the situation and leading to humorous and revealing moments that culminate in Mr. Carter's eventual decision.
