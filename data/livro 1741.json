    "resumo": "\"The Singing Man: A Book of Songs and Shadows\" by Josephine Preston Peabody is a collection of poetry published in the early 20th century, likely in the formative years of the 1910s. The book examines the themes of human struggle, labor, and the quest for joy amidst the sorrows of life. It intricately weaves together insights about the plight of the common man, the burdens of poverty, and the elusive nature of happiness, encouraging readers to reflect on the deeper meaning of existence.  The collection features a variety of poignant poems, each illustrating the challenges faced by the \"singing man,\" a symbol of the working class. Through vivid imagery and lyrical language, Peabody connects the listener to the laboring experience, portraying the inherent dignity and resilience found in toil despite the overwhelming shadows of despair. The poems explore the relationship between wealth and poverty, the longing for connection and beauty amid hardship, and the persistent hope for a brighter future. Ultimately, Peabody's work serves as both a celebration and a lament for those who labor but struggle to find their worth and joy in the world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
