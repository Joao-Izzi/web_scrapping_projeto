At the start of the book, Shelton introduces the reader to the expansive Sonoran Desert and its geographic features, highlighting the Saguaro National Monument's significance. The author describes both the Rincon Mountain and Tucson Mountain sections of the monument, specifying their elevation ranges, biodiversity, and the environmental gradients that influence the diverse plant and animal communities found there.
