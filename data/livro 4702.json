    "resumo": "\"Gregg's Commerce of the Prairies, 1831-1839, Part 2\" by Josiah Gregg is a historical account written in the early 19th century that chronicles the experiences of an American trader in the New Mexico and Northern Mexico region. This work offers insights into the social, economic, and cultural conditions of the time, as well as interactions with the indigenous peoples and the Mexican government. The text delves into various aspects of life during that era, addressing issues such as the judicial system, religious practices, and the dynamics between Americans and Mexicans.  The opening of this volume introduces readers to the governmental framework of New Mexico and the administrative challenges faced by both Americans and locals. Gregg particularly critiques the judicial corruption and prejudice against American traders, exemplifying the tensions that existed during this period. Several anecdotes illustrate the biases inherent in the treatment of foreign merchants, highlighting incidents involving both legal injustices and social ostracization. As the narrative unfolds, it sets the stage for discussing the broader societal conditions, including gambling, marriage customs, and religious practices, thereby providing a vivid snapshot of life in a region marked by both opportunity and conflict.
