    "resumo": "\"The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts. Part 1: The Economy of Vegetation\" is a philosophical poem likely written in the late 18th century. The work seeks to intertwine the beauty of imagination with the rigor of scientific principles, particularly focusing on botany and the physiological processes of plants, inspired by the systems of the renowned Swedish naturalist Linnaeus.   At the start of the poem, the narrative introduces a call to the \"Goddess of Botany,\" inviting her to bestow her influence over the natural world. The opening lines establish a dialogue between a spiritual genius and the goddess, highlighting the delicate balance between the energies of nature, the elements, and their connection to the growth and wonders of vegetation. The poem paints vivid imagery of nature coming to life, with personified elements like Nymphs and Gnomes participating in the chiaroscuro of creation and revitalization. Throughout, there’s an interplay of scientific inquiry and poetic embellishment, blending natural phenomena with mythological references, setting the stage for an exploration of plant life’s mysteries as well as the philosophical musings surrounding it.
