    "resumo": "\"Observations critiques sur l'archéologie dite préhistorique, spécialement en ce qui concerne la race celtique\" by Félix Robiou is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work examines the historical and archaeological perspectives of prehistoric archaeology, focusing particularly on the Celtic race and the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Europe. The author critiques previous hypotheses surrounding prehistoric societies and stresses the importance of aligning archaeological findings with historical facts.  At the start of the publication, Robiou discusses the significant progress made in the study of antiquity during the 19th century, highlighting the vast knowledge gained regarding ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, and others. He emphasizes the audacity of attempting to reconstruct social histories based solely on material artifacts in the absence of written documentation. Moving to the crux of his argument, he challenges the existing notions of prehistoric archaeology that suggest a straightforward evolutionary path from primitive to advanced societies, asserting that many of these theories lack substantial evidence and logical consistency. Robiou aims to establish a more rigorous framework for understanding the archaeological record of prehistory, particularly emphasizing the distinct characteristics of Gauls and Celts.
