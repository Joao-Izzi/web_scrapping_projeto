    "resumo": "\"Fair and Warmer\" by E. G. Von Wald is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century. The narrative explores themes of intellectual curiosity and the consequences of civilization's emotional numbness and control over natural impulses. Set in a distant future where inhabitants possess telepathic abilities, the story begins to unfold around the central character, Tensor, who finds himself mentally disturbed after encountering a group of primitive aliens.  The storyline primarily follows Tensor as he grapples with a peculiar melancholia triggered by his interaction with the aliens, which leads him to a state of nonconformity against the strict social norms of his highly advanced civilization. As Tensor's curiosity grows regarding the aliens and their primitive behaviors, he is forced into an unexpected investigation by the governing Council, which views his condition as a threat to societal stability. Upon making contact with the aliens, particularly a female, Tensor grapples with the awakening of his primal instincts and emotions, challenging his previous understandings of himself and the nature of civilization. The plot develops into a mix of exploration, romance, and a commentary on the balance between progress and the loss of humanity. Ultimately, Tensor's encounters force a reevaluation of the values of his society and the inherent dangers of intellectual curiosity suppressed by civilization's constraints.
