    "resumo": "\"Worldly Ways & Byways\" by Eliot Gregory is a collection of essays written in the late 19th century that humorously explores the intricacies of social behavior and cultural norms in American society. The text touches upon various themes, including the roles of charm and the evolving expectations of women, the peculiarities of American manners, and the engage-and-reengage dynamics of social interactions. Through light, philosophical musings, Gregory illustrates the absurdities and contradictions present in contemporary social life.  The opening of \"Worldly Ways & Byways\" presents a reflection on social customs, particularly focusing on the nature of charm and the transformations in societal expectations for women. Gregory begins by discussing the historic Pele Mele—a custom in which rank is not recognized—and draws parallels to modern society, portraying it as a perpetual competition for social standing. He highlights how charm, often overlooked in the modern woman, plays a crucial role in social interactions, lamenting that contemporary behaviors might detract from the enduring allure and influence of femininity. The author invites readers to consider deep questions surrounding identity and social expectations, setting the stage for a witty and insightful examination of American cultural life at the turn of the 20th century.
