    "resumo": "\"Histoire de France - Moyen Âge (Vol. 3 / 10)\" by Jules Michelet is a historical account written in the mid-19th century. This volume delves into the complexities of medieval French history, exploring significant events and influential figures, particularly focusing on the political dynamics of the time, including the relationships between the French crown, the papacy, and various noble houses.   The opening of the book sets the stage by discussing the aftermath of the crusade to Tunis led by Philippe le Hardi, son ascension to power, and the shifting allegiances within the French nobility. It highlights the tension between familial ties and territorial ambitions, particularly through the character of Charles d'Anjou, who seized control in Italy and wielded significant influence over Sicily. The narrative introduces the brewing discontent in Sicily against the oppressive rule of Charles and traces how these tensions lead to insurrections amid the backdrop of wider political and social struggles in Europe at the time.
