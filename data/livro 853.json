    "resumo": "\"History of the Transformer\" by Friedrich Uppenborn is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This book provides a detailed exploration of the evolution of the transformer, focusing on its invention and the key concepts underlying electromagnetic induction. The author, who served as the editor of the \"Centralblatt für Elektrotechnik\" and was chief of the electro-technical testing station in Munich, aims to clarify the developments leading to the transformer’s design and significance in electrical engineering.  In the book, Uppenborn traces the origins and advancements in transformer technology, beginning with Michael Faraday's foundational discoveries in electromagnetic induction. He discusses various inventions and patents by key figures in the field, including those of Professor Page, Ruhmkorff, and the important contributions of Zipernowsky, Déri, and Bláthy in establishing a self-regulating transformer system. The narrative emphasizes the progression in understanding electromotive force and the eventual shift from series to parallel connections of transformers for effective current distribution in electrical lighting. Uppenborn's account serves not only to document the technological advancements but also to address misconceptions surrounding the invention's priority and applications.
