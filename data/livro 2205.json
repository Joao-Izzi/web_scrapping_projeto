    "resumo": "\"Romney\" by Randall Davies is a biography focused on the life and work of the English portrait painter George Romney, written in the early 20th century. The timeframe suggests it was composed during a period when there was renewed interest in historical art, particularly in examining the legacy of lesser-known yet significant artists from previous centuries. This book likely seeks to illuminate Romney's contributions to portrait painting and to place him among the ranks of his more celebrated contemporaries, such as Reynolds and Gainsborough.  The book delves into Romney's artistic career, detailing his rise to prominence during the 18th century and exploring the influence of his personal experiences on his work. Davies examines themes such as Romney's struggle with his identity as a portrait painter, his dissatisfaction with the commercial nature of portrait commissions, and the profound impact of his muse, Lady Hamilton. Through insightful analysis of Romney's techniques and the historical context of his work, the biography presents a compelling portrait of an artist who, while overshadowed by his peers during his lifetime, played a crucial role in the development of English portraiture. With illustrations of his notable works, Davies effectively argues for a reevaluation of Romney's legacy in the pantheon of British art. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
