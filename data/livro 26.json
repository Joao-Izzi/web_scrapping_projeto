    "resumo": "\"The World Court (Vol. I, No. 2, Sept. 1915)\" by Various is a publication focused on international law and peace efforts, written during the early 20th century. This issue discusses the concept of a World Court designed to resolve international disputes without resorting to war, highlighting the necessity for a judicial body to maintain peace among nations. Contributors include notable figures advocating for the establishment of a formal court system to govern international relations.  The opening portion of this volume presents a discourse on the \"penalty of leadership,\" emphasizing the challenges faced by innovators and leaders—be it in the arts, industry, or politics—who often encounter envy and criticism as they set benchmarks for excellence. This section references historical examples to illustrate how great achievements provoke both admiration and scorn, reinforcing the idea that true leadership endures despite backlash. The discussion lightly transitions into the overarching theme of the publication, which advocates for a World Court as a means of establishing a more just and stable international system, away from the cycle of war and uprising fueled by human emotions like envy and ambition.
