    "resumo": "\"Tractor Principles\" by Roger B. Whitman is a technical guide written in the early 20th century. This publication primarily explores the mechanics and operation of gas engine tractors, covering their design, handling, maintenance, and repair. With its comprehensive approach, the book aims to equip readers with the essential knowledge required to understand and operate various types of tractors effectively.  At the start of this work, the author distinguishes between tractors and automobiles, emphasizing the need for tractor operators to have a solid understanding of their machines due to the diverse designs and mechanisms employed by different manufacturers. Whitman argues that the ability to recognize and comprehend tractor components directly correlates with successful operation and maintenance. He outlines essential tractor parts—such as the engine, clutch, and transmission—and underscores that the effective handling of these machines is crucial for maximizing their operational efficiency. This opening portion sets the stage for a detailed exploration of each component and principle associated with tractor functionality. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
