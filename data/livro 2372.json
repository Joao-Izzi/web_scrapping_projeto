    "resumo": "\"Preservation of Bull Semen at Sub-Zero Temperatures\" by N. L. VanDemark et al. is a scientific publication that discusses the techniques and research findings related to the freezing of bull semen, written in the mid-20th century, specifically in the late 1950s. The book provides an in-depth examination of the preservation methods necessary to maintain the viability and fertility of bull semen at sub-zero temperatures, which is critical for artificial insemination in livestock breeding.  The publication details a series of experiments and findings on various factors influencing the successful freezing of bull semen, such as the optimal selection of semen, appropriate diluents, glycerol concentrations, and the rates of freezing and thawing. It emphasizes the importance of each procedure in enhancing sperm survival rates post-thawing. The authors outline practical steps for collecting, diluting, freezing, and thawing bull semen, offering valuable insights into best practices for researchers and practitioners in the field of animal science and veterinary medicine. Overall, this work serves as a comprehensive guide for those involved in the freezing and preservation of semen in the agricultural sector. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
