    "resumo": "\"Enoch Arden, &c.\" by Alfred Tennyson is a narrative poem published during the late 19th century. The poem follows the life of the titular character, Enoch Arden, a sailor whose love for Annie Lee intertwines with themes of love, loyalty, and the passage of time, exploring the emotional ramifications of human relationships and the trials that come with them.  At the start of \"Enoch Arden,\" Tennyson introduces a picturesque seaside setting where three children—Enoch, Annie, and Philip—play together, establishing a deep bond in their youth. As they grow older, Enoch's love for Annie becomes more pronounced, while Philip silently harbors his own feelings for her. Enoch works hard to provide for Annie, culminating in their marriage. However, after a series of hardships, including a shipwreck that leaves Enoch stranded for years, a painful love triangle subtly develops. The narrative sets the stage for Enoch's return home, only to find the dynamics of love and loyalty forever altered. This opening portion envelops readers in a melody of nostalgia and impending sorrow, promising a tale that explores the heart's resilience and the weight of unfulfilled dreams.
