    "resumo": "\"The Street That Wasn't There\" by Clifford D. Simak and Carl Jacobi is a speculative fiction novella written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around an eccentric recluse, Mr. Jonathon Chambers, who finds himself ensconced in a dramatically shifting realityâ€”where familiar places and objects begin to inexplicably vanish. The narrative wrestles with themes of perception, reality, and the power of collective consciousness as it explores the boundaries of existence and the fragility of the human-made world.  In the novella, Mr. Chambers adheres to a strict routine in his solitary life, walking the same streets every evening. However, his predictable existence is shattered when he discovers that parts of his familiar neighborhood, including the confectionery he frequents, have mysteriously disappeared. As he grapples with the implications of this phenomenon, he reflects on a book he had written decades earlier, positing that humanity's collective minds shape reality. As a plague decimates the population, the world around him begins to dissolve into a gray nothingness, forcing Mr. Chambers to confront the grim possibility that the threads holding his reality together are fraying. Ultimately, he finds himself in a race against time to retain his sense of self and the life he has known, facing the slowly encroaching void alone. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
