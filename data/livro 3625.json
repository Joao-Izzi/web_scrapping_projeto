    "resumo": "\"Der tolle Koffer\" by Felix Schloemp is a humorous collection of anecdotes and jokes written in the early 20th century. The book engages with the quirks of travel, focusing on various humorous situations that arise in the context of train journeys and hotel stays. Through its witty observations, it also features a range of colorful characters, poking fun at the idiosyncrasies of society during this time period.  The opening of the text sets the tone for the collection by introducing a lively discussion among passengers at a dining table about travel suitcases, thereby highlighting everyoneâ€™s different preferences. Amidst laughter, a young man, who initially remains silent, prepares to contribute to the conversation. His eventual humorous comment about having a suitcase made from seal fur suggests a mix of seriousness and whimsy that permeates the anecdotes likely to follow. This mix of playful banter and the exploration of everyday travel experiences creates an inviting atmosphere for readers who enjoy light-hearted humor. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
