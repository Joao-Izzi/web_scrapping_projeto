    "resumo": "\"The First Man on the Moon\" by Alfred Coppel is a science fiction short story written in the mid-20th century. The narrative revolves around John Thurmon, a character who is consumed by the ambition of being the first human to land on the moon, yet his journey is tainted by a crime—he has murdered his friend Wayne to ensure that he alone achieves fame. The story intertwines themes of ambition, isolation, and the psychological toll of achieving one’s dreams at any cost.  In the story, John Thurmon finds himself alone on the lunar surface following the crash landing of his rocket, having killed his companion Wayne to secure his legacy as the first man on the moon. As he revels in his triumph, he struggles with the reality of his actions and the fear of dying alone. The story takes a dark turn when Thurmon's sense of victory is shattered by the uncanny appearance of Wayne’s corpse, a manifestation of his guilt and madness. Ultimately, Thurmon's mental state deteriorates as he confronts the consequences of his ambition, leading to a tragic and violent climax that underscores the destructive nature of his obsessive quest for glory.
