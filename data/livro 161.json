    "resumo": "\"Attila: Historiallinen romaani kansainvaelluksen ajoilta\" by Felix Dahn is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The book delves into the tumultuous times of the Huns and their infamous leader, Attila, during the era of mass migrations across Europe. The story begins with the ominous atmosphere of a summer night along the banks of the Danube River, setting a tone of foreboding for the complex interplay of characters and nations that will unfold throughout the narrative.  The opening of this novel introduces readers to the dramatic setting, where a group of men, led by a young character named Daghar, is conspiring under the cover of darkness. They express urgent concerns about Attila's vast power and the impending danger it poses to their clans and tribes. Tension escalates as they discuss plans for resistance, revealing the varied histories and alliances among different tribes, including Gepids, Ostrogoths, and others. As they debate their fate, the narrative hints at the personal stakes involved, especially concerning the daughter of King Wisigast, named Ildiko, who becomes a focal point of both desire and peril in these politically charged times. This intricate mix of personal and communal struggle sets the stage for a compelling exploration of loyalty, bravery, and the harsh realities of war and survival.
