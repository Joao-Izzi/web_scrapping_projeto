    "resumo": "\"Joyce\" by Mrs. Oliphant is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the main character, Joyce, a young woman poised between her modest background and the upper-class society she finds herself navigating. The book explores themes of identity, social class, and the quest for belonging, particularly through Joyceâ€™s interactions with those above her station, such as the Colonel and Captain Bellendean.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Norman Bellendean, who returns from military service to take possession of his family estate as he comes of age. He attends festivities in his honor which serve as a backdrop to reflections on his upbringing and experiences abroad. Among the festivities, Joyce makes a significant impression on Colonel Hayward, who notes her unusual beauty and the mystery surrounding her name. The opening sets the stage for a complex social drama where Joyce, a schoolmistress and a foundling, grapples with her origins and the expectations of her new acquaintances, hinting at possible connections to nobility and her struggle for self-identity amidst contrasting social worlds.
