    "resumo": "\"The Moon is Green\" by Fritz Leiber is a science fiction novel written during the early 1950s. Set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear war and radiation, the story explores themes of beauty, despair, and the human condition as society grapples with the consequences of its actions. The narrative revolves around the dichotomy of life and death amid an oppressive environment that suppresses any remnants of beauty.  The story follows Effie, a woman confined to a life of fear and isolation with her controlling husband, Hank. As radiation has rendered the outside world toxic, the couple lives in a sealed apartment, cut off from the beauty of nature. Effie's yearning for beauty leads her to open a window one night, encountering a man named Patrick who claims that life has returned outside in a transformed state. As Effie becomes enchanted with Patrick's tales of a vibrant new world, tensions escalate dramatically when Hank discovers their interaction. What unfolds is a confrontation not just between the characters, but also between hope and despair, as Effie's longing for beauty leads her to chase the allure of the outside world, ultimately challenging the rigid beliefs that bound her. The novel reflects on the costs of survival, the nature of fear, and the potential for regeneration in a world marked by devastation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
