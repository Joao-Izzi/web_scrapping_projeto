    "resumo": "\"The Tin Woodman of Oz\" by L. Frank Baum is a children's fantasy novel written during the late 19th century. The story follows the beloved character, the Tin Woodman, as he embarks on a quest to find his long-lost fianc√©e, Nimmie Amee, alongside his friends Woot the Wanderer and the Scarecrow. This adventure promises to be filled with new discoveries, whimsical characters, and the kind of enchantment readers have come to love in the Oz series.  At the start of the story, the Tin Woodman is introduced, seated in his magnificent tin castle, when a wanderer named Woot arrives. Intrigued by the boy's curious nature, the Tin Woodman shares his history, revealing how he became a living being made of tin and the story behind his unrequited love for Nimmie Amee. Following a conversation that encourages the Tin Woodman to take action, he resolves to find her with the help of Woot and the Scarecrow. The opening sets the stage for their journey, foreshadowing encounters with magical beings and the exciting challenges they will face in the rich, imaginative world of Oz.
