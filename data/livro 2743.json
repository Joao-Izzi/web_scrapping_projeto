    "resumo": "\"The Passing of the Great Race; or, The Racial Basis of European History\" by Madison Grant is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book explores the concept of race as it relates to the development and history of European societies, positing heredity as a more significant factor than nationality or language in shaping human destinies. Through its analysis, it seeks to highlight the enduring impact of racial characteristics on societal structure and evolution.  The opening of the work introduces the authorâ€™s thesis that true understanding of history must hinge on the study of races rather than traditional national or linguistic narratives. It sets the stage for a critical examination of the biological movement in history, emphasizing the stability of heredity over the influence of environment. The text outlines the author's intention to present a historical sketch of European races, tracing distinctive traits back to primitive origins while addressing contemporary implications regarding race and society. The introduction also establishes a framework for differentiating between race, language, and nationality, indicating a strong premise for Grant's arguments against the mixing of races and the importance of understanding racial influences in historical narratives.
