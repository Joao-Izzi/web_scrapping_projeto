    "resumo": "\"What Will He Do with It? — Volume 07\" by Baron Edward Bulwer Lytton is a novel likely written in the mid-19th century. The story unfolds in a social milieu rich with complex interactions and themes of marriage, societal expectations, and personal aspirations, centering around several characters, particularly Guy Darrell, who seems caught in a web of romantic intrigue with three notable women: the intelligent Miss Honoria Vipont, the beautiful but empty Lady Adela, and the spirited heiress Flora Vyvyan.  The opening of the volume presents an engaging dialogue between Darrell and Colonel Alban Morley, where they discuss the virtues and drawbacks of potential romantic partners, illustrating their contrasting perspectives on love and relationships. As they ride through the park, they admire various young ladies while reflecting on the qualities that make a suitable companion or wife. The narrative hints at Darrell's internal conflicts regarding age, desirability, and the expectations placed upon him, which suggests that personal relationships will be deeply explored. The shifting dynamics of young love, ambition, and the inevitable passage of time set the stage for the unfolding drama. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
