    "resumo": "\"The English Utilitarians, Volume 1 (of 3)\" by Leslie Stephen is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work seeks to explore the influential school of English Utilitarianism, mainly represented by key figures such as Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, and John Stuart Mill. The author intends to provide insights into the movement's impact on contemporary thought and political actions, alongside a deep examination of the social, political, and legislative landscapes during the period.  At the start of the book, Stephen outlines the significant role of the English Utilitarians over three generations, their commitment to practical applications as tied to societal issues, and their intellectual lineage from earlier philosophical thought. He emphasizes the connection between the philosophies of the Utilitarians and the political and social conditions of their time, insisting on a biographical and historical approach rather than purely theoretical analysis. The introductory section establishes a complex framework of political structures, societal norms, and individual agency that shaped the Utilitarian ethos and delves into the historical contexts that led to the emergence of these influential thinkers.
