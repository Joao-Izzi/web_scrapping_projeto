    "resumo": "\"Letters from a Son to His Self-Made Father\" by Charles Eustace Merriman is a collection of humorous epistolary letters written in the early 20th century. The book follows Pierrepont Graham, a college student at Harvard, as he writes to his father, John Graham, a self-made merchant in Chicago, discussing his life experiences, studies, and personal mishaps during his formative years. The letters reflect the generational divide between the father's practical, business-oriented perspective and the son's more whimsical and introspective view of life and education.  The opening of the book introduces Pierrepont and sets the tone for his correspondence with his father. In his first letter, he describes the challenges of adjusting to college life, contrasting the expectations of his father's business acumen with the reality of his own experiences at Harvard. He humorously recounts the delivery of mundane but socially awkward situations, such as dealing with the unappetizing food linked to his father's company and the pressures of maintaining his family's reputation while navigating the social scene. Through witty observations and reflections on various amusing encounters, Pierrepont establishes a character that is both relatable and endearing, thereby inviting readers to join him in his journey of self-discovery and familial connection.
