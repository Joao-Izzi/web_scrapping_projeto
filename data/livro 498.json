The story begins with a lively depiction of two men, Wade and Ed, camping in the mountains of Colorado, hinting at themes of adventure, camaraderie, and romance. The narrative shifts between their rustic outdoor life and Wade's encounters with Evelyn Walton, the girl who symbolizes love and beauty against the backdrop of nature.  The opening of the book introduces Wade, who finds himself captivated by Evelyn when he glimpses her on a train platform. Their brief yet electric interaction is marked by youthful passion and charm, as they exchange names and promises, hinting at the deeper connection that will unfold. Following this, the story transitions to Wade five years later, exploring his new life in the quaint Eden Village, replete with its lilac fragrances and charming homes.
