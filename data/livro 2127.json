    "resumo": "\"Night Court\" by Norman Arkawy is a thought-provoking short story written in the mid-20th century. This piece, set within a dystopian vision of New York City, explores themes of societal judgment and the moral implications of entertainment derived from the suffering of others. The narrative unfolds in a grotesque courtroom, which serves as a spectacle for an audience that derives pleasure from the humiliation and punishment of the \"undesirables.\"  In the story, Julie, a reluctant first-time visitor, accompanies her enthusiastic friend Stan to the Night Court, where they witness a series of bizarre and grotesque cases involving homeless men who lack identification cards. As the proceedings unfold, the audience erupts in laughter and applause, relishing the misery of the defendants. Julie grows increasingly uncomfortable and horrified with the proceedings, ultimately realizing that the court represents a cruel mockery of justice and a societal failure to address the underlying issues faced by those being judged. The story culminates in Julieâ€™s understanding of the dark truth behind the spectacle and serves as a critique of societal indifference towards the marginalized.
