    "resumo": "\"Publications of the Mississippi Historical Society, Volume 01 (of 14), 1898\" is a collection of historical essays and articles edited by Franklin L. Riley, likely written during the late 19th century. This volume serves as a scholarly resource, aiming to document, explore, and analyze various facets of Mississippi's history and its notable figures. The book contains pieces focused on literature, political issues, and cultural history, reflecting on the contributions and legacy of Mississippians.  The beginning of this publication introduces the primary focus on Mississippi's literary contributions and the significant yet underappreciated poet known as the \"Backwoods Poet,\" S. Newton Berryhill. It discusses Berryhill's modest origins, educational journey, and the circumstances of his life that formed his poetic voice. Despite facing profound physical challenges, including an incapacitating illness, Berryhill became a prolific poet and editor, and this opening section sets out to emphasize the importance of his work in Mississippi's literary landscape, encouraging further appreciation and study of local literary heritage.
