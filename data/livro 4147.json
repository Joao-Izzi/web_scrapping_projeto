    "resumo": "\"The Monomaniac\" by Émile Zola is a novel written in the late 19th century. This gripping work explores the theme of obsession and its impact on human behavior through the character of Jacques Lantier, whose uncontrollable urge for violence shapes the narrative. Zola's intricate portrayal of the human psyche is matched by a vivid representation of the railway environment, offering insights into both personal and social dynamics.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to several characters, including Roubaud, an assistant station-master, and his wife, Séverine, who display a complex relationship filled with tension and unease. The narrative unfolds in a Parisian setting, primarily depicting moments in their apartment, juxtaposed with the bustling railway. As Roubaud awaits Séverine's return from shopping, his growing impatience hints at underlying jealousy, culminating in a terrifying confrontation when he questions her regarding trust and fidelity. The opening sets a somber tone, foreshadowing the darker themes of betrayal and violence as Roubaud’s emotions spiral into a horrifying fit of rage, revealing his potential for brutality.
