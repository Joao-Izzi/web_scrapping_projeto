    "resumo": "\"Young Peoples' History of the War with Spain\" by Prescott Holmes is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book aims to engage young readers with the narrative and significance of the 1898 conflict between the United States and Spain, particularly focusing on the humanitarian motivations behind the war and the actions of the American military. Through a detailed exploration of key events and figures, it invites children to understand the struggle for Cuban independence and the subsequent military engagements.  The opening of the book sets the stage for the conflict, outlining the dire humanitarian crisis in Cuba under Spanish rule and the growing sentiment in the United States for intervention. It highlights how the atrocities against the Cuban people prompted American assistance, which eventually led to war when Spain's failure to respond adequately was met with demands for the cessation of hostilities. The author emphasizes the pivotal role that American naval and military forces played in the conflict, while also foreshadowing significant engagements like the sinking of the battleship Maine that escalated tensions. This portion serves as both an informative introduction to the war's causes and an invitation for young readers to explore the historical narrative further.
