    "resumo": "\"Mimi's Marriage\" by Lidiia Ivanovna Veselitskaia is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the life of Mimi, a young woman navigating her engagement and the expectations placed upon her by society and her family. With a focus on the dynamics of relationships and the societal pressures of marriage, the narrative explores themes of love, social status, and personal happiness.  The opening of \"Mimi's Marriage\" introduces us to the titular character, Mimotchka, who has just become engaged. The initial excitement surrounding her engagement is illustrated through the reactions of her family, particularly the delight of her aunts. Despite their enthusiasm, it is clear that Mimotchka is unsure of her own feelings towards her fianc√©, Spiridon Ivanovitch. As she reflects on her past relationships, including a previous, more charming engagement that ended abruptly, the complexities of her emotions begin to emerge. This opening sets the stage for a deeper exploration of her character's internal conflicts and the societal expectations that she must navigate. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
