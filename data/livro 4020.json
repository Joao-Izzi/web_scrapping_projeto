    "resumo": "\"La Guerre Sociale\" by André Léo is a political discourse that focuses on the themes of war, justice, and societal conflict, likely written in the early 1870s, reflecting the upheavals following the Paris Commune. This work is a passionate critique of the powers that perpetuate war, specifically addressing the consequences of the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent civil strife in France. It exposes the hypocrisy of political authorities and situates the struggles of the oppressed within the broader context of social inequities and the fight for justice.  In this discourse, André Léo passionately confronts the horrors and moral failings surrounding the civil war experiences in France during that tumultuous era. She articulates the atrocities committed against the working class during the Paris Commune, defending the revolutionaries while condemning the ruling powers for their crimes against humanity. Highlighted throughout are the themes of freedom and equality, emphasizing that true peace cannot exist without social justice and that the rhythm of history dictates the ongoing struggle between the privileged and the oppressed. Léo's fervent call for solidarity against oppressive regimes resonates through her detailed critiques of the political landscape, underlining the essential connection between social justice and genuine peace.
