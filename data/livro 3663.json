    "resumo": "\"Norwegische Volksmährchen vol. 2\" by Asbjørnsen and Moe is a collection of Norwegian folk tales written in the mid-19th century. This volume presents a variety of whimsical and often moralistic stories, each characterized by magical elements and relatable human experiences. The tales involve various characters including clever young men, greedy trolls, enchanting princesses, and magical creatures, exploring themes of adventure, cleverness, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.  The opening of this collection begins with the story \"Die sieben Füllen,\" which follows three brothers, the youngest of whom is called Aschenbrödel. Each brother attempts to fulfill the king's challenge to guard the king's seven magical foals, only to fail due to their distractions. Aschenbrödel, undeterred by his brothers' mockery, decides to attempt the task as well. With the help of a mysterious old woman he meets in the woods, he succeeds where his brothers do not, leading to a series of magical encounters that promise to change his fate. Through this opening tale, the reader is introduced to the book's enchanting atmosphere and the theme of perseverance in the face of adversity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
