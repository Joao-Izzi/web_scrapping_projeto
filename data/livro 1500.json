    "resumo": "\"Poetical Works of Robert Bridges, Volume 5\" by Robert Bridges is a collection of poetic works, likely written in the early 20th century, reflecting the artistic and literary styles of that period. This volume contains two notable plays: \"The Christian Captives,\" a tragedy set against the backdrop of conflict between Christians and Muslims, emphasizing themes of captivity, love, and cultural clashes, and \"Humours of the Court,\" which likely delves into the intricacies of courtly life and politics. The characters involved, particularly Almeh, a Moorish princess, and Ferdinand, a Portuguese prince, navigate complex emotions amidst war and societal expectations.  The opening of \"The Christian Captives\" sets a dramatic scene in Fez, where Almeh discovers the agony of the Christian prisoners held captive, sparking her curiosity and compassion. She longs to understand them better, hearing their haunting songs that stir feelings of pity and wonder within her. Meanwhile, her father, the King of Fez, prepares for war, revealing the deeper tensions between the two cultures and the political strategizing that binds Almeh's fate to the conflict. Through her interactions with her maid Zapel and her determination to see the captives, Almeh becomes a central figure whose developing awareness of love, duty, and honor plays a significant role as the narrative unfolds.
