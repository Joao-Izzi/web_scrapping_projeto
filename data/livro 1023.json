    "resumo": "\"Bullets & Billets\" by Bruce Bairnsfather is a collection of autobiographical sketches written during the early 20th century, specifically during World War I. This account details the experiences of Bairnsfather, a British officer, as he journeys through the war, from his arrival in France to life in the trenches and the impact of military duty on day-to-day life. With a mix of humor and poignant observations, the text captures the absurdity and hardships faced by soldiers, offering readers an insight into the camaraderie and challenges inherent in wartime experiences.  At the start of the book, Bairnsfather describes his arrival in France, setting the stage for his journey as a new officer. He vividly recounts the chaos of landing at Havre and the transition from England to the Front. He humorously illustrates the disorganization of military life, struggles with transportation, and the somber anticipation of his first day at the trenches. As he navigates the challenging conditions and muddied reality of war, readers get a sense of his initial naivety and gradually deepening understanding of the somber, absurd nature of trench warfare. This opening establishes the tone and themes of the memoir, balancing humor with a stark realism that characterizes Bairnsfather's reflections throughout the narrative.
