    "resumo": "\"Letters to a Friend, Written to Mrs. Ezra S. Carr, 1866-1879\" by John Muir is a collection of personal correspondence written in the late 19th century. This unique work captures Muir's thoughts and reflections as he shares his deep love for nature, especially through the lenses of botany and geology. The letters are addressed to Mrs. Carr, who Muir considers a close friend and mentor, revealing both Muir’s inner life and his experiences in the natural world.  At the start of the letters, Muir expresses profound gratitude for Mrs. Carr’s friendship and encouragement, fondly recalling their conversations about nature during his time at the University of Wisconsin. As he writes from various locations, including Yosemite Valley, Muir's correspondence pulses with descriptions of his encounters with flora, the beauty of the landscapes around him, and his ongoing pursuits in scientific observation and invention. The opening portion of the book establishes a heartfelt and contemplative tone, setting the stage for Muir’s spiritual and intellectual journey through nature as he balances his work with his passion for botanical exploration.
