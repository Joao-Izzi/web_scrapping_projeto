    "resumo": "\"Two on the Trail: A Story of Canada Snows\" by E. E. Cowper is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story follows siblings Nell and David Lindsay, who find themselves alone in a log house deep in the Canadian wilderness while their father is away checking traps. With worries about their father's safety looming over them, the two children must navigate both the icy wilderness and potential threats from nearby trappers who may know of their father's secret savings hidden in their home.  At the start of the tale, Nell and David express concern over their father's absence, which has stretched beyond his expected return. As they ponder their situation in their isolated log house, tensions rise with the arrival of Jan Stenson, a rough trapper who brings news of their fatherâ€™s injury. With the knowledge that their father may need assistance and the realization that they themselves might be in danger concerning the hidden money, Nell hatches an ambitious plan to leave the shack, gather the money, and make their way to safety while avoiding Stenson and others who may have ill intentions. The opening sets up a thrilling adventure of survival, sibling loyalty, and the stark beauty of the Canadian snowscape as they embark on their journey into the unknown.
