    "resumo": "\"Essays of Michel de Montaigne — Volume 01\" by Michel de Montaigne is a collection of philosophical essays written during the late 16th century. A pioneer of the essay as a literary form, Montaigne explores a wide array of topics reflecting on human nature, emotions, and existential questions. His introspective style offers insights into his own thoughts and experiences, thereby presenting a unique lens through which readers can examine various facets of life and morality.  The opening of the volume begins with a preface that sets the stage for Montaigne's essays, likely intended to address a literary gap of its time by establishing a library edition of his works. The preface highlights Montaigne's significance as a classic writer whose candid explorations of his mind and the world around him have influenced many great thinkers, such as Bacon and Shakespeare. Following this, the contents list introduces the various chapters, starting with contemplative themes such as sorrow, idleness, and friendship. Overall, the beginning of this collection emphasizes Montaigne's intent to share his philosophical musings while laying out a framework for the diverse range of subjects that will follow in subsequent chapters.
