    "resumo": "\"The Trufflers: A Story\" by Samuel Merwin is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Peter Ericson Mann, a playwright struggling with creative burnout and increasingly frustrated by the changing landscape of theater represented by modern women and their new roles, including his fascination with a young woman named Sue Wilde. As he navigates both his artistic decline and his tumultuous interactions with Sue, the narrative explores themes of artistic integrity, gender dynamics, and the complexities of modern relationships.  At the start of the book, Peter Mann is depicted as a disheartened playwright whose past successes have dwindled into failures. He meets Sue, a spirited young woman with a boyish appearance, who critiques his work and challenges his worldview. Their conversation reveals Peter's anxieties about women and changes in society, while Sue's bold nature captivates him. As they both confront their beliefs about art, relationships, and societal expectations, the tension between traditional values and progressive ideals unfolds, setting the stage for Peter's awakening and the potential conflict with Sue's evolving ambitions within the new artistic environment of New York City.
