    "resumo": "\"The Metamorphoses of Publius Ovidus Naso in English Blank Verse Vols. I & II\" translated by J.J. Howard is a poetic epic translation of Ovid's classic work, likely written in the early 19th century. This ambitious collection explores themes of transformation and mythological tales, encapsulating the divine interactions and events that change characters and the world around them. With numerous transformations at its core, it reflects on human nature, love, and the whims of the gods.  At the start of this translation, the narrative unfolds with Ovid invoking the muses to aid him in telling the tales of transformation from the chaotic origins of the universe through the ages of mankind. The text describes the creation of the world and the subsequent ages—golden, silver, bronze, and iron—each marked by a decline in morality and virtue. As the narrative progresses, it introduces pivotal characters and events, such as Deucalion and Pyrrha's survival of a great flood and the birth of various mythological figures, setting the stage for the richly woven tales of love and tragedy that follow. Through lush imagery and rhythmic verse, the opening captures the epic's essence as a tapestry of myth intertwined with the human experience. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
