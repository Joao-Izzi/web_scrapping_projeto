    "resumo": "\"Redburn. His First Voyage\" by Herman Melville is a novel written during the mid-19th century. The narrative follows the adventures of Wellingborough Redburn, a young man from a respectable family who sets out to explore the world by becoming a sailor in the merchant navy. The story delves into his experiences, challenges, and the stark realities of life at sea as he embarks on his first voyage, grappling with sea sickness, hardship, and the camaraderie of sailors.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Redburn as he prepares to leave his childhood home. He receives a shooting jacket and a fowling piece from his brother to aid his passage. With a vivid imagination fueled by romantic notions of the sea, he boards a boat to New York, where he encounters the harsh realities of urban life and the difficulties of securing a position on a ship. As he tries to navigate these new experiences, Redburn must confront his insecurities and the camaraderie of the sailors, all while he struggles with homesickness and the challenges of his new life at sea. The opening chapters set the stage for a coming-of-age story that intertwines themes of adventure, identity, and the contrasts between dreams and reality.
