    "resumo": "\"One Hundred Merrie And Delightsome Stories\" by Robert B. Douglas is a collection of humorous prose tales written in the late 19th century. The book presents a series of short stories that revolve around the comedic and often scandalous encounters of various characters, primarily dealing with themes of infidelity and clever deception within the spheres of love and marriage. The collection, inspired by earlier French works, captures the social dynamics of the time with wit and satire, demonstrating the intricacies of human relationships and social status.  The opening of this anthology introduces the first story, \"The Reverse of the Medal,\" which sets the tone for the subsequent narratives. It recounts how a cunning citizen orchestrates a secret romance with his neighbor's wife while her husband is away. The twist occurs when the husband returns unexpectedly, leading to a series of comedic misdirections and misunderstandings that ultimately maintain the citizen's deception. The story highlights themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the lengths to which individuals will go to mask their indiscretions, all while showcasing the humorous complications that arise from such entanglements. This sets the stage for a collection filled with clever plots and comical resolutions. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
