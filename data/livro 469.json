    "resumo": "\"The Downfall (La Débâcle): A Story of the Horrors of War\" by Émile Zola is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative explores the catastrophic failures of the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War, particularly focusing on the dismal battle of Sedan and its aftermath. The story is anchored around two main characters, Jean and Maurice, representing different facets of French society as they experience the chaos and tragedy of war.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to a weary camp of French soldiers stationed near Mulhausen, just before the war escalates. As tensions build, Corporal Jean Macquart and Private Maurice Levasseur navigate the dismal conditions, awaiting news of impending conflict. Amidst their daily struggles, fears of an approaching enemy and the realities of their situation become apparent. The opening chapters set the stage for both the psychological and physical horrors of war, establishing a tone of impending doom as the regiment is soon swept into the chaos of retreat and disarray following their disastrous encounters with the Prussians. The complexities of camaraderie and class differences between Jean, a peasant soldier, and Maurice, a young man of privilege, begin to unfold as they confront the grim realities of their circumstances.
