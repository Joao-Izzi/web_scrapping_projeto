    "resumo": "\"Artist and Public, and Other Essays on Art Subjects\" by Kenyon Cox is a collection of essays on art criticism written in the early 20th century. The book explores the relationship between artists and their audiences, discussing the evolution of art in the context of societal changes, particularly after the French Revolution. It addresses key figures such as Raphael and Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, highlighting the challenges artists face in connecting with the public amidst evolving tastes and understandings of art.   The opening of the book presents Cox's argument about the fundamental disconnection between modern artists and their audiences, which he attributes to societal transformations deemed revolutionary. He critiques the notion that all great artists are inherently misunderstood, positing that past masters enjoyed harmony with their patrons and the public. Cox emphasizes the chaotic state of contemporary art as a result of this dislocation and argues that real art must stem from a mutual understanding between artists and their audiences, a theme that sets the stage for subsequent essays in the collection.
