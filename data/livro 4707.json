    "resumo": "\"Mark Twain's Letters — Complete (1853-1910)\" by Mark Twain is a collection of personal correspondence spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through these letters, readers gain insight into the life, thoughts, and character of one of America's most iconic authors. The letters are a reflection of Twain's experiences, humor, and philosophical musings, detailing his evolution from a young printer to a celebrated humorist and social commentator.  At the start of the book, Twain’s early letters reveal a youthful and ambitious Samuel Clemens, who is just beginning to navigate the world away from his small-town beginnings. The opening portion includes a fragment of a letter to his sister Pamela from the summer of 1853, where he details a visit to the Great Exhibition in New York, expressing wonder at the spectacle of the event while also reflecting on his family's circumstances. He writes with a mix of earnestness and youthful bravado, painting a portrait of a young man filled with dreams and aspirations as he embarks on a journey that will shape his literary career. The early letters capture both the excitement of Twain's adventures and the familial bonds that informed his character, setting the stage for a lifetime of rich and varied correspondence.
