    "resumo": "\"Persia Revisited\" by Sir Thomas Edward Gordon is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work chronicles Gordon's observations and reflections during his journey through Persia, touching upon various aspects including the social, political, and economic conditions of the country at the time, particularly following the assassination of Shah Nasr-ed-Din. With a background as a military attach√© and oriental secretary, Gordon provides firsthand insights into the state of Persia under its new rulers.  The opening of \"Persia Revisited\" begins with Gordon's journey from London to Tehran, illustrating his travel experiences with vivid descriptions of the landscapes, people, and the evolving conditions in regions like Baku and Enzelli. He comments on the bustling life among Persian communities abroad and the significant presence of Persian workers in various industries. Gordon's narrative transitions into observations about the socio-political climate in Persia, referencing the late Shah's policies, economic developments, and the effects of foreign aspirations on local autonomy. His observations provide a blend of personal travelogue and socio-political commentary, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of Persia's dynamics in the subsequent chapters.
