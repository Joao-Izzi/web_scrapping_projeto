    "resumo": "\"Atlantic Classics, Second Series\" by Ellery Sedgwick et al. is a collection of essays written in the early 20th century. The book compiles thought-provoking essays from various authors, tackling enduring themes and topics that resonate with human experiences. Each piece illustrates the editorsâ€™ intent to preserve contemporary expressions in literature while fostering a deeper appreciation for the written word.  The beginning of this collection introduces readers to the editor's purpose and the specific content of the series. In the preface, the editor discusses the success of the first series and aims to highlight the value of literature that connects students to the world outside their education. The opening essay, \"Dogs and Men\" by Henry C. Merwin, reflects on the profound relationship between humans and dogs, arguing for the emotional and moral lessons we can learn from these companions. Through anecdotes and observations, Merwin emphasizes how dogs can foster empathy and humanity within people, setting a tone of introspection and appreciation for the connections we share with all living beings.
