    "resumo": "\"Estampas de viaje: España en los días de la guerra\" by Luis G. Urbina is a travel narrative written in the early 20th century. The book recounts Urbina's personal reflections and experiences as a correspondent for a Cuban newspaper during his visit to Spain in the midst of World War I. It captures his observations of the Spanish culture, landscapes, and people, intertwined with the broader context of the war's emotional turmoil.  The opening of the work introduces Urbina's arrival in Spain, where he expresses his awe and curiosity about the land and its people. He reflects on the contrast between his vibrant memories of Havana and the cold, mist-shrouded atmosphere of New York, which he describes as melancholic. As he navigates through feelings of admiration for Spain's historical beauty and concern for its present state during the war, the tone is both introspective and poetic. Urbina shares anecdotes and vivid imagery, hinting at the complex relationship between his homeland and Spain, along with the nostalgia and hopes he harbors for both places. This sets the stage for a rich exploration of Spain's cultural landscape during a turbulent time in history. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
