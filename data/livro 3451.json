    "resumo": "\"The Connecticut Wits, and Other Essays\" by Henry A. Beers is a collection of literary essays written in the early 20th century. The book specifically delves into the contributions of a group of 18th-century Connecticut writers known as the Connecticut Wits, who sought to cultivate American literature in a post-Revolutionary society. Their ambitions included modernizing the educational curriculum and producing poetry that resonated with the American experience, amidst historical and political pursuits.  At the start of the volume, Beers introduces the Connecticut Wits as a significant literary movement that emerged in a time of national identity formation. He describes a camaraderie among Yale graduates who shared common goals in elevating American literature, addressing their satire, and creating works that would reflect the vastness and beauty of America. The narrative offers insights into their attempts to blend literary ambition with patriotism, while also touching on their lesser-known relatives and contemporaries, thus setting the stage for the literary discussions that follow in the essays.
