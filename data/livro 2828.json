    "resumo": "\"Le Corbeau = The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe is a renowned narrative poem written during the early 19th century, a time marked by Romanticism in literature. This haunting poem explores themes of loss, despair, and the quest for understanding in the face of death, particularly focusing on the narrator's sorrow over the loss of his beloved Lenore.   The poem opens with the narrator reflecting on his melancholy state on a dreary December night, when he hears a mysterious tapping at his chamber door. Upon opening the door to find only darkness, he soon discovers a stately raven that perches itself above the door. The raven, while embodying an ominous presence, speaks only one word: \"Nevermore.\" As the narrator engages with the raven, he spirals further into despair, asking it questions about his lost love, Lenore, and the possibility of finding solace or reunion in the afterlife. Each response from the raven inexorably leads the narrator deeper into his hopelessness, culminating in an acknowledgment that his grief will persist indefinitely, as encapsulated by the line \"my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be liftedâ€“nevermore.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
