    "resumo": "\"Phaidros\" by Plato is a philosophical dialogue written in the 4th century BC. This work explores themes of love, rhetoric, and the nature of knowledge, presenting a conversation primarily between Socrates and Phaedrus. The dialogue contrasts the philosophical understanding of love with shallow expressions of affection, asserting the superiority of genuine wisdom over superficial knowledge.  At the start of \"Phaidros,\" Socrates and Phaedrus are introduced as they walk outside the city to discuss a speech by Lysias regarding love. Phaedrus reveals that Lysias argues one ought to favor the non-lover over the lover, claiming that the latter's passion leads to jealousy and irrationality. Socrates expresses skepticism about this view, suggesting that true love transcends mere physical desire and requires a deeper connection to the soul and the pursuit of knowledge. The conversation soon delves into the nature of rhetoric and the philosophical implications of love, setting the stage for a more profound examination of these concepts.
