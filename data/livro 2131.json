    "resumo": "\"Histoire du Bas-Empire. Tome 02\" by Charles Le Beau is a historical account written in the early 19th century. This volume focuses on the late period of the Roman Empire, detailing the reigns of various emperors and significant events that shaped the empire during its decline. The text promises an in-depth examination of figures like Constant, Magnence, and Constance as they navigate political intrigue, warfare, and the struggles of maintaining power within a crumbling empire.  At the start of the narrative, the author presents the state of the empire as one of deterioration, both in governance and military prowess. The opening chapters introduce the characters of the emperors Constant and Constance, describing their contrasting styles and personal shortcomings. While Constant grapples with theological disputes and the influence of his ministers, Constance is embroiled in military campaigns against both internal usurpers like Magnence and external threats from Persia. The text sets the stage for complex power dynamics, violent confrontations, and the overarching theme of a civilization on the brink of collapse, laying a foundation for a thorough exploration of these turbulent times.
