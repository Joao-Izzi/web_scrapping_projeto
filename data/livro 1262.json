    "resumo": "\"The Young Woodsman; Or, Life in the Forests of Canada\" by J. Macdonald Oxley is a coming-of-age novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Frank Kingston, a determined and ambitious boy who aspires to follow in his father's footsteps and take up a lumbering career in the forests of Canada after the sudden death of his father. As he embarks on this new chapter of his life, readers are introduced to the contrasts between the comforts of his previous life and the challenges he is about to face in a rugged and demanding wilderness environment.  The opening of the book depicts Frank's transition from childhood to the responsibilities of adulthood following the death of his father. As he expresses his eagerness to begin work in the lumber camps, there is tension between him and his mother, who fears for his safety and wishes for him to pursue a different path. Oxley skillfully portrays the dynamics of Frank's family life, his character development, and the allure of adventure in the Canadian wilderness. As he sets off for the woods, Frank's initial excitement is palpable, yet it is mixed with both the grief of his loss and the weight of the expectations placed upon him. This rich beginning promises an engaging exploration of Frank's journey into the harsher realities of a woodsman's life, compelling readers to follow his trials, growth, and the relationships he will forge along the way.
