    "resumo": "\"The Constitutional History of England from 1760 to 1860\" by Charles Duke Yonge is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book aims to analyze the evolution of the English constitution during a pivotal century marked by significant political and social transformations, including the Reformation, the American Revolution, and reforms such as the Reform Bill of 1832. It offers an in-depth exploration of the events, legislation, and key figures that influenced constitutional changes during this era, providing context for the democratic developments that ensued.  The opening of the work sets the stage for Yonge's examination of constitutional evolution, beginning with a discussion of Mr. Hallam's previous historical conclusions that end with George II's death. Yonge highlights the subsequent transformative events under George III, emphasizing the numerous critical legal and political changes that arose, such as parliamentary reforms and the abolition of colonial practices. He introduces key themes such as the discussions of political power, democratic representation, and civil rights, focusing on how these elements shaped the public sentiment and governance of the time. As a precursor to later chapters, Yonge critically assesses the political climate at the accession of George III, setting the foundation for the comprehensive historical narrative to follow.
