    "resumo": "\"Shoshone-Bannock Subsistence and Society\" by Robert F. Murphy and Yolanda Murphy is an anthropological publication written in the mid-20th century. The work explores the subsistence patterns, social organization, and cultural history of the Shoshone and Bannock tribes, particularly in the context of their interactions with the American frontier. The authors conducted ethnographic research from 1954 to 1957, mainly focusing on the complexities surrounding land claims and historical usage of territory by these Indigenous peoples.  The opening portion of the monograph establishes the researchers' motivations and challenges while documenting the Shoshone and Bannock tribes. It explains their investigation's connection to land compensation lawsuits initiated by the tribes and highlights the significant difficulties encountered in gathering reliable oral histories and ethnographic data. The authors detail their fieldwork experience, including interactions with elders on reservations, while emphasizing the importance of corroborating historical information through ethnohistoric methods. This reflective introduction sets the stage for a deeper examination of the tribes' ecological and social systems, as well as their cultural adaptations through historical changes.
