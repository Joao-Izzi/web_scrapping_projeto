    "resumo": "\"Sainte Lydwine de Schiedam\" by J.-K. Huysmans is a biographical account written in the early 20th century. This work focuses on the life and tribulations of Sainte Lydwine, whose experiences are chronicled through the narratives of her contemporaries and later hagiographers. It dives into her profound spiritual struggles, miraculous incidents, and the context of conflict-ridden Europe around the end of the 14th century.  The opening of \"Sainte Lydwine de Schiedam\" introduces the historical backdrop during the time of Lydwineâ€™s life, a period marked by political turmoil, war, and widespread calamities such as plagues in Europe. It paints a vivid picture of the chaos within France as various leaders vie for power amidst civil strife, while also detailing the effects of the wider conflict including the Hundred Years' War and the social unrest in the Netherlands.
