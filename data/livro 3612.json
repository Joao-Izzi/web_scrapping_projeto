    "resumo": "\"Eskimo Folk-Tales\" by Knud Rasmussen and W. J. Alexander Worster is a collection of traditional stories derived from the oral folklore of the Eskimo peoples, likely compiled in the early 20th century. The work presents a vivid glimpse into the life, beliefs, and cultural practices of the Eskimos through a series of engaging tales. Each story sheds light on various themes such as survival, spiritual beliefs, and relationships, reflecting the unique worldview of this Arctic community.  At the start of the collection, the introduction reveals the author's intimate connection with the stories, having collected them during his time in Greenland. It describes how Rasmussen's experiences and explorations informed the narratives, which range from tales of creation and mythical adventures to moral lessons and humorous anecdotes. The opening tales feature characters such as two men who wish to travel the world, a marginalized boy who meets ghosts, and an obstinate man who grapples with the supernatural, all setting the stage for the rich storytelling tradition that defines Eskimo folklore. Each narrative is imbued with elements of spirituality, struggle, and humor, inviting readers to appreciate the depth and diversity of Eskimo cultural heritage.
