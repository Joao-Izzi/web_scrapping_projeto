    "resumo": "\"The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition, Vol. 19\" by Stevenson et al. is a collection of literature likely assembled in the early 20th century. This volume includes two major works: \"The Ebb-Tide,\" a tale exploring themes of disillusionment and moral ambiguity through the experiences of its characters, and \"Weir of Hermiston,\" which examines familial relationships and societal expectations. The narrative is set against the backdrop of the South Pacific, populated by various characters who navigate both physical and emotional turmoil.  At the start of \"The Ebb-Tide,\" the story unfolds on a beach in Papeete, where three outcasts, Robert Herrick, an American called Brown, and a clerk known as Huish, find themselves united by their shared hardship. Each man bears the weight of their past failures and struggles with their current desolate circumstances, characterized by hunger, cold, and a sense of moral defeat. The opening pages vividly depict their plight, establishing a tone of melancholy and desperation, as they contemplate the depths of their fall from grace and their yearning for redemption or escape, leading to discussions about their pasts and dreams of a different life.
