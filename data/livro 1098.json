    "resumo": "\"Roger Trewinion\" by Joseph Hocking is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story, set against the backdrop of Cornwall, follows the life of Roger Trewinion, who grapples with a family curse that brings tragedy to the Trewinion lineage. The narrative is steeped in themes of superstition, family dynamics, and supernatural elements, suggesting a rich tapestry of drama and intrigue.  The opening of the book introduces us to Roger, who is not only navigating the complexities of family expectations but is also drawn into a mysterious world of legends and curses. Hocking sets the stage by describing Roger's encounter with an enigmatic old woman named Deborah Teague, who warns him about the dark fate that might befall him and his family. Following a dramatic shipwreck on the ominously named \"Devil's Tooth,\" Roger exhibits bravery in saving others, including a young woman named Ruth Morton. This initial portion establishes a sense of urgency and foreboding, hinting at the looming consequences of the Trewinion curse, which intertwines with Roger's quest for identity and purpose amid familial pressures.
