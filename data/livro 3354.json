    "resumo": "\"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Part 28\" by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is a classic novel written during the early 17th century, a significant period in the Spanish Golden Age. This section of the book continues the adventures of Don Quixote, a misguided nobleman who fervently believes he is a knight-errant destined to revive chivalry. The tale showcases his delusional exploits and the comical interactions he has with the realistic world around him, often in the company of his pragmatic squire, Sancho Panza.  In this chapter, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza embark on a new adventure that leads them to the river Ebro, where they encounter a supposed \"enchanted bark,\" which is actually a small boat that floats away from the riverbank. Convinced that he must help someone in distress, Don Quixote commands Sancho to tie their animals and joins him on the boat. As they drift toward a water mill, Quixote mistakes the mills for a castle and believes he must confront the \"monsters\" for a noble quest. The situation quickly devolves into chaos when the millers rescue them from drowning as Don Quixote's delusions clash humorously with reality. Ultimately, this episode highlights the ongoing theme of the conflict between illusion and reality, characteristic of Cervantes' work, while also conveying the absurdity and humor in their adventures.
