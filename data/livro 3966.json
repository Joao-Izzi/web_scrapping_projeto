    "resumo": "\"Snowdrop & Other Tales\" by the Brothers Grimm is a collection of classic fairy tales written in the late 19th century. The book features well-known stories, including the tale of Snowdrop, a beautiful princess threatened by her jealous stepmother, alongside other enchanting tales like \"The Pink,\" \"Briar Rose,\" and \"Ashenputtel.\" Each story intertwines elements of magic, morality, and adventure, often culminating in a moral lesson or a poetic justice.  The opening of the collection introduces the tale of Snowdrop, beginning mid-winter as a Queen, sewing at her window, accidentally pricks her finger, and wishes for a child as beautiful as the snow. When Snowdrop is born, the Queen dies, and the King remarries a vain and jealous woman who eventually seeks to eliminate Snowdrop when she learns the child has outshone her beauty. The narrative unfolds with themes of envy and compassion as Snowdrop escapes into the forest, finding refuge with seven dwarfs. The story cleverly intertwines peril and benevolent rural magic, setting the stage for a classic battle between good and evil. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
