    "resumo": "\"Euthyphro\" by Plato is a philosophical dialogue written in ancient Greece, likely during the late 5th century BC. It features the characters Socrates and Euthyphro, who engage in a discussion about the nature of piety and impiety in the context of Socrates' impending trial for impiety. The dialogue serves as a critical exploration of religious and moral concepts, examining what constitutes pious behavior and exposing the inconsistencies in Euthyphro's definitions of such concepts.  The narrative unfolds in the porch of the King Archon, where Socrates encounters Euthyphro, who is prosecuting his own father for murder. As Socrates seeks to understand the essence of piety, he challenges Euthyphro's assertions, leading to a series of definitions and redefinitions that ultimately highlight the complexity and ambiguity surrounding concepts of morality in religion. Socrates illustrates the flaws in Euthyphro's reasoning, demonstrating that what is considered pious may differ among the gods themselves, which complicates the idea that an action can be universally defined as holy or unjust. Euthyphro's inability to provide satisfactory answers leaves Socrates without the clarity he sought, culminating in a poignant exploration of the relationship between divine command and moral reasoning.
