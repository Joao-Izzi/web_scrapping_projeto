    "resumo": "\"Fairy Gold\" by W. W. Jacobs is a comedic short story that falls into the genre of humorous fiction, likely written in the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around themes of deception, ambition, and the follies of human nature, particularly focusing on the interactions between friends and the mishaps that ensue in the pursuit of hidden wealth.  The story centers on Mr. Augustus Teak and his friend Mr. Alfred Chase, who devise a plan to discover a sum of money that Teak believes his wife has secretly saved over the years. As Chase moves in as a lodger, he is tasked with uncovering the hiding place of her supposed savings. The plot thickens with comedic misunderstandings and domestic squabbles as Teak attempts to distract his wife to enable Chase's investigation. Ultimately, chaos ensues when Chase is found in a compromising position, leading to the revelation that Mrs. Teak was the one who moved the money herself, leaving both men baffled and humorously exposed to the consequences of their scheming.
