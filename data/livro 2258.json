    "resumo": "\"Easy Does It\" by E. G. Von Wald is a science fiction story written in the mid-20th century. The narrative revolves around the themes of civilization, conditioning, and the juxtaposition of modern life against a primal wilderness. The protagonist, Hal Webber, finds himself in an unexpected situation where he must navigate his conditioning in a setting far removed from the comforts of his technologically advanced life.  The story begins with Hal experiencing tension due to his overdue Civilization Conditioning Treatment, which is necessary to maintain the civilized demeanor expected of him as a member of society. After a catastrophic air crash, he finds himself stranded in the wilderness with Lois Bruchner, an Outlander who embodies the raw and free-spirited nature of life outside of civilization. As they navigate their new reality, Hal experiences a transformation away from his conditioned responses, leading to an exploration of his emotions and instincts. The interactions between him and Lois challenge his perceptions of civilization, ultimately raising questions about what it means to be civilized and the price of emotional suppression. The narrative concludes with Hal returning to his old life, seemingly unchanged yet profoundly aware of the contrast between his previous existence and the untamed freedom he experienced with Lois.
