    "resumo": "\"The Third Officer: A Present-day Pirate Story\" by Percy F. Westerman is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Alwyn Burgoyne, a former Royal Navy sub-lieutenant who has taken a position as the Third Officer on the merchant ship S.S. Donibristle. As the narrative unfolds, the ship becomes the target of a pirate attack, thrusting Burgoyne and his crew into a perilous situation filled with action and intrigue.  The opening of the book introduces the reader to the S.S. Donibristle, with Burgoyne engaged in the quick tasks of preparing the ship for departure from Vancouver. A sense of foreboding is established through mentions of ships going missing, hinting at the dangers that lie ahead. As Burgoyne interacts with crew members and passengers—including the intriguing Hilda Vivian—tension builds with the imminent threat of piracy. The first chapter effectively sets the scene for adventure, introducing key characters while hinting at forthcoming conflict that will challenge Burgoyne's courage and leadership.
