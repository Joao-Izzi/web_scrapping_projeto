    "resumo": "\"The Crisis of Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-One in the Government of the United States\" by A. D. Streight is a historical account written during the mid-19th century. This work addresses the political turmoil and questions about the integrity of the United States' Union in the face of rising tensions leading to the Civil War. It critiques the compromises made with Southern states and emphasizes the need to restore the supremacy of federal laws, arguing that allowing states to dictate terms threatens the very foundation of American democracy.  The opening portion of the text sets the stage for examining the profound crisis faced by the nation in 1861. The author outlines the various causes contributing to the upheaval, such as the contentious issue of slavery, state sovereignty, and the growing aggressive demands from Southern states. Streight presents a narrative that calls for a resolute response from the Union, contending that earlier compromises failed to quell dissent and have led to an accelerated descent into chaos. He underscores the importance of enforcing laws firmly to preserve the Union, drawing on historical precedents from the founding fathers to support his arguments against secession and the necessity of a strong central government.
