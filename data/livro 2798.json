    "resumo": "\"Bertrand of Brittany\" by Warwick Deeping is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers on the life of Bertrand du Guesclin, a young man grappling with the unkindness of his mother, Dame Jeanne, as well as with his own identity and self-worth in a society that prizes appearance and gentility. In an era of noble conflicts and personal struggles, the story promises an exploration of themes such as honor, family loyalty, and the journey towards self-acceptance.  The opening of the novel establishes a vivid portrayal of the du Guesclin family dynamic, particularly the friction between Bertrand and his mother, who is embarrassed by her firstborn's looks and rough demeanor. As Bertrand grows up amidst harsh treatment and neglect, he perseveres through bitterness and a sense of injustice, seeking a place in his family's world. The interactions between family members set the stage for Bertrand’s challenges, with his mother favoring his more attractive brother, Olivier, while he yearns for recognition and love. The tone is both melancholic and reflective as Bertrand’s plight is revealed, hinting at the inner strength that will ultimately drive his narrative forward.
