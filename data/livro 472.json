    "resumo": "\"The Magazine Style-Code\" by Leigh H. Irvine is a manual for writers and typographers written in the early 20th century. The book serves as a comprehensive guide for individuals involved in writing and printing, including authors, proofreaders, and publishers. It discusses the necessity of style codes, typography systems, and the principles of clear written communication to ensure that printed materials maintain a high standard of clarity and consistency.  The opening of the manual outlines the author's motivations for creating this guide, emphasizing the chaotic state of many publishing houses and the resultant need for a systematic approach to typography. Irvine highlights the significance of uniformity in aspects such as punctuation, abbreviations, and formatting, citing Theodore Low De Vinne's influential work as a foundation. He articulates issues in the relationship between writers and printers, noting that misunderstandings often stem from inconsistency in the authors' original manuscripts. Irvine aims to reduce mistakes in printed materials by establishing well-defined rules and expectations that all involved parties should adhere to. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
