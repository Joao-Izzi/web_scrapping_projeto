    "resumo": "\"The Purpose of the Papacy\" by John S. Vaughan is a theological treatise written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the historical and spiritual significance of the Papacy within the Catholic Church, focusing particularly on the infallibility of the Pope and the Church's authority. The author argues that despite the various sects and the confusion present in the modern religious landscape, the Papacy remains a steadfast source of unity and truth.  At the start of the book, Vaughan sets the stage by lamenting the prevalent disarray among Christian sects in Protestant regions, emphasizing the necessity for a consistent and reliable source of spiritual guidance. He presents the Papacy as a divine institution that carries the \"torch of divine truth\" from its origins with Saint Peter to the reigning Pope, Pius X. His introductory chapters highlight the unique historical resilience of the Papacy, asserting that the Pope provides not only leadership but also an unerring moral compass for the faithful in a world rife with dissent and division. Vaughan's arguments aim to establish the Pope's role as the preservation of faith and unity in Christianity against the backdrop of widespread religious plurality.
