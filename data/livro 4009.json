The book delves into themes of obsession, isolation, and the complex relationship between life, art, and desire.

The story follows Olivier as he inherits a rundown estate and discovers a world filled with remnants of the past, including cherished art and old memories linked to his family. As he isolates himself further, he becomes fixated on the idea of creating an idealized companion in the form of a life-sized doll.
