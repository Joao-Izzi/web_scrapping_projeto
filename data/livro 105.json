    "resumo": "\"Highways in Hiding\" by George O. Smith is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around Steve Cornell, an esper who experiences a traumatic accident while eloping with his fianc√©e, Catherine Lewis. After the accident, Steve is faced with not only intense physical injuries but also the mystery surrounding Catherine's sudden disappearance. This exploration of telepathy, subterranean highways, and obscure diseases forms the foundation of a compelling narrative that intertwines personal loss with greater conspiracies.  At the start of the narrative, Steve awakens in a hospital following a serious car crash, only to be informed by the attending doctor that he was alone during the incident and that Catherine, whom he insists was with him, is unaccounted for. As he grapples with his trauma and the apparent lack of evidence to support his memory of her presence, the novel delves into themes of mental perception, reality versus illusion, and a hidden underground society that may hold secrets to both Catherine's fate and a mysterious disease impacting humanity. Steve's quest for the truth leads him to question the nature of existence, telepathy, and the societal implications of a disease that alters the very fabric of humanity.
