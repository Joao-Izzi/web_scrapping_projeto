    "resumo": "\"The Rivals: A Comedy\" by Richard Brinsley Sheridan is a comedic play written in the late 18th century. The story revolves around the complex romantic entanglements and misunderstandings of several characters, prominently featuring Lydia Languish, a headstrong young woman, and Captain Absolute, who is secretly in love with her while posing as another man, Ensign Beverley, to win her heart. Through a mix of social commentary and humor, the play explores themes of love, identity, and societal expectations.  At the start of \"The Rivals,\" the author introduces the characters and sets the stage in Bath, where different plots begin to unfold. We meet Thomas and Fag, who discuss the unexpected arrival of their masters, Captain Absolute, who is in pursuit of Lydia Languish, and Sir Anthony Absolute, the captainâ€™s father, eager to marry him off. Lydia confides in her friend Julia about her secret love for Beverley while expressing her frustration with her aunt, Mrs. Malaprop, who is determined to see her married to the socially acceptable but less appealing Mr. Acres. The opening effectively establishes the romantic tension and the comedic misunderstandings that will follow as the characters navigate their relationships amid familial pressures and disguises.
