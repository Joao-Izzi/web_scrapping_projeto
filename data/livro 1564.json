    "resumo": "\"Novelle\" by Edmondo De Amicis is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The book features a variety of narratives that explore themes of friendship, nostalgia, and the poignant emotions tied to childhood and youth. Through various characters and their experiences, the author delves into their lives and relationships, presenting a vivid picture of society.  The opening of \"Novelle\" introduces the narrator's reflections on the fleeting nature of memories and friendships from childhood and adolescence. He laments forgetting names and faces of former companions, emphasizing how these memories fade over time yet remain significant. The narrator contrasts the joy of youth with the bittersweet realization that friendships were often shallow, lacking in deeper emotional bonds. As he recollects moments spent with friends at a military school, there's an underlying sense of nostalgia and a yearning for the simplicity of those days, setting a contemplative tone for the stories that follow.
