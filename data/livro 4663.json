    "resumo": "\"Romance\" by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative is steeped in themes of adventure and longing, primarily following John Kemp, a young man from a humble farming background who yearns for a life filled with excitement, romanticism, and adventure. His journey is sparked by connections with characters like Carlos Riego and the enigmatic Tomas Castro, who introduce him to a world far beyond the confines of his rural life.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to John Kemp as he reflects on his past life and the fateful day he encountered Carlos Riego, who becomes a pivotal character in his quest for adventure. Kemp's perception of his ordinary existence is sharply contrasted with the romantic notions of life espoused by Carlos, who ties his family legacy to intrigue and fortune in Cuba. Kemp's emotions shift between envy, yearning for love and adventure, and a burgeoning desire to escape his mundane reality. As Kemp is drawn into Carlos's world, he becomes entangled in a series of unexpected events, including being thrust into the dangerous underbelly of smuggling and piracy, setting the stage for an exploration of his desires and the gravitas of choices that will define his destiny.
