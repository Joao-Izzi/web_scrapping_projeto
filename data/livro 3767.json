    "resumo": "\"Alias the Lone Wolf\" by Louis Joseph Vance is a novel first published in the early 20th century. This story follows the character Andr√© Duchemin, who is secretly the infamous thief known as the Lone Wolf, as he attempts to escape the threats posed by his enemies while navigating various escapades and romantic entanglements in post-war Europe.  The opening of the novel introduces Duchemin as he receives his \"walking papers\" from the British Secret Service, which severs his ties to England and prompts his exile. With a mix of melancholy and resolve, he embarks on a journey through the picturesque yet dangerous landscapes of France, initially seeking solitude and a reprieve from his past. However, he soon finds himself entangled in a series of unexpected events, including a violent confrontation that reveals his skills as an adventurer and protector. As he encounters characters like the young widow Eve de Montalais, who draws him into a social circle filled with intrigue, Duchemin grapples with his identity and the inescapable pull of his past as the Lone Wolf. This sets the stage for a series of adventures that intertwine with themes of loyalty, love, and the shadows of one's former life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
