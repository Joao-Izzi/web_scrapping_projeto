    "resumo": "\"The Confession of a Child of the Century\" by Alfred de Musset is a novel written in the early 19th century. The narrative follows the protagonist, Octave, who reflects on his tumultuous emotions and experiences in the context of the chaotic aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. With themes of love, betrayal, and the quest for meaning in a fractured society, the book articulates the struggles of its young characters as they navigate their feelings amid personal and historical upheaval.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Octave's profound despair after discovering his mistress's infidelity at a lively dinner party. This revelation sends him spiraling into a tumult of emotions, mixing feelings of heartbreak with philosophical musings about love and existence. As he confronts the pain of betrayal, he oscillates between a desire for vengeance and an overwhelming sense of loss, which is further complicated by his intimate relationship with his friend, who urges him to move on. With vivid imagery and deep introspection, the opening chapters set the stage for Octave's inner conflict as he grapples with the moral failings of those around him and the futility of searching for genuine love in a world rife with deception and disillusionment.
