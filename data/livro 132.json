    "resumo": "\"Anatomy of the Cat\" by Jacob Reighard and H. S. Jennings is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work serves as a comprehensive laboratory manual for students studying mammalian anatomy, specifically focusing on the anatomical structure of the domestic cat. The book aims to fill a gap in the existing literature by providing clear, detailed descriptions alongside numerous illustrations, making it an essential resource for learners engaged in dissection.  The opening of the book introduces the authorsâ€™ goal of providing a succinct and accurate account of cat anatomy for students, addressing previous shortcomings in existing texts. In the preface, they highlight the necessity for a handbook that concentrates solely on the anatomy of the cat without overwhelming extraneous information. This section also outlines the practical applications of the work, stressing that it should accompany hands-on dissections, and emphasizes the importance of clear nomenclature and visual aids to facilitate learning. Overall, the beginning sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the skeletal, muscular, and organ systems of the cat throughout the forthcoming chapters.
