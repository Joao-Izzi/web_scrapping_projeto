    "resumo": "\"William of Malmesbury's Chronicle of the Kings of England\" by William of Malmesbury is a historical account likely written in the early 12th century. This influential work offers a comprehensive narrative of English history from the earliest times up to the reign of King Stephen, detailing the exploits and reigns of various English kings, as well as important social and cultural contexts. The tome not only serves as a chronicle of events but also integrates biographical elements, providing insight into the lives of the monarchs and their impact on English history.  At the start of the chronicle, the author introduces the circumstances leading to the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in 449 A.D. The narrative commences with the decline of Roman influence and the desperate call to the Germans for military aid against the Scots and Picts, culminating in the arrival of the Anglo-Saxon tribes led by Hengist and Horsa. The text delves into the political machinations of King Vortigern and the ensuing battles between the Saxons and the Britons. Initial engagements and betrayals are highlighted, along with a first glimpse into the character of Vortigern and his son, Vortimer, setting the stage for the subsequent struggle for dominance in post-Roman Britain. The opening portion lays the foundation for an extensive examination of the early historical context that shaped England's monarchy and society. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
