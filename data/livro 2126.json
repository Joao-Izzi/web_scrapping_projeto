    "resumo": "\"Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion: A Study in Survivals\" by John Cuthbert Lawson is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The work explores the connections between modern Greek folklore and ancient Greek religious beliefs, aiming to unveil how contemporary customs may reflect and preserve traditions from ancient times. Through this examination, Lawson sheds light on the continuity of cultural and religious practices across centuries.  The beginning of the study provides an insightful preface in which the author shares the background of his research conducted in Greece. He discusses his method of collecting folklore, emphasizing the importance of engaging with local customs and traditions rather than relying solely on written texts or formal interviews. He expresses gratitude to the villagers who unwittingly contributed to his research and outlines his intention to examine the links between modern Greek practices and ancient traditions, thus establishing a new perspective on the understanding of Greek religion and culture. Overall, this opening section sets the stage for a detailed investigation of the survival of ancient traditions in modern Greece. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
