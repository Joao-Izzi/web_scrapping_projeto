    "resumo": "\"Our Den\" by E. M. Waterworth is a children's novel written during the late 19th century. The story focuses on the adventures of Edric, a boy with a physical disability, as he navigates life when his lively cousins come to stay with him at his family's rural farm. The book likely explores themes of family, friendship, courage, and the transformative power of companionship and play.  In \"Our Den,\" Edric feels constrained by his condition and often prefers the company of books to that of other children. However, when his cousins—three boisterous boys and their spirited sister—arrive unexpectedly, he is thrust into a whirlwind of excitement and energy that challenges his perceptions of his own limitations. As they explore their new environment, including an intriguing oak chest in a fort-like tower room, the group encounters various adventures that test their resilience and ingenuity. Through these experiences, Edric gradually learns to engage more fully with the world around him, ultimately leading to personal growth and deeper family connections, particularly with his uncle, whose return and hidden past add a layer of mystery and resolution to the story.
