    "resumo": "\"Water Supply: the Present Practice of Sinking and Boring Wells\" by Ernest Spon is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work explores the engineering aspects of well construction, providing insights into geological considerations and methodologies for successfully sinking and boring wells. The book aims to inform engineers and those involved in water supply about the practices and principles governing effective water extraction.  The opening of the book introduces the dire necessity for adequate water supply in growing communities and emphasizes the advantages of wells in providing uncontaminated water compared to surface sources. Spon discusses the importance of geological knowledge in selecting appropriate sites for wells to minimize costs and maximize water yield. He references specific cases where costly drilling produced scant water due to poor site selection, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of geological factors affecting water availability in subsequent chapters. Overall, this section establishes the foundational rationale for the engineering practices and technical discussions that will follow in the text. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
