    "resumo": "\"Dealings with the Dead, Volume 2\" by Lucius M. Sargent is a collection of musings and anecdotes reflecting on mortality, society, and the customs surrounding death, written in the mid-19th century. It presents a unique narrative voice, characterized by wit and a keen observation of societal norms related to remembrance and burial practices, particularly in relation to the deceased elite of Boston. Through its humorous yet poignant style, the text explores themes of life, death, and the eccentricities inherent in human behavior toward both.  The opening of the work presents a vivid tableau of Sargent's reflections on historical figures of Boston's aristocracy and their funeral attire, emphasizing the absurdity and grandeur of past sartorial choices. As he recounts tales of individuals like Colonel Barnabas Clarke and Tailor Tommy Marshall, the author blends historical anecdotes with personal observation, presenting a tapestry of societal commentary. Through these stories, Sargent also raises questions regarding cultural rituals around death, particularly humorously critiquing the practices, such as the Irish wake, while discussing the serious implications of premature burial. This blend of humor with thoughtful inquiry sets the tone for a reflective exploration of the dead and the living's relationship with them, inviting readers to ponder the nature of existence and the legacies we leave behind.
