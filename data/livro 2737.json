    "resumo": "\"Dombey and Son\" by Charles Dickens is a novel written during the early 19th century. The story revolves around Mr. Dombey, a proud and prosperous businessman, and his aspirations for his newborn son, Paul, as he contemplates the legacy of the family firm bearing his name. The novel explores themes of pride, gender roles, and familial relationships as it sets the stage for the contrasts between Mr. Dombey's stern demeanor and his vulnerable family members.  The beginning of \"Dombey and Son\" introduces us to Mr. Dombey, who is reveling in the birth of his son while simultaneously displaying an unsettling detachment from his wife, Mrs. Dombey, who is gravely ill. Their little daughter, Florence, is almost an afterthought to Mr. Dombey, who is solely focused on his son as the heir to the family name and business. The sensitive dynamics between Mr. Dombey, his wife, and Florence begin to unfold, hinting at the estrangement that will plague their relationships. The opening sets a somber tone, foreshadowing the challenges and transformations that the characters will face as the narrative progresses. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
