    "resumo": "\"Cuentos ilustrados\" by Nilo María Fabra is a collection of illustrated stories written in the late 19th century. The stories cover various themes, likely interweaving elements of Spanish culture, history, and perhaps social commentary through fictional narratives. The book features characters such as Santiago el Mayor, a prominent figure in Spanish tradition, who interacts with divine and earthly matters, addressing issues faced by the Spanish people.  The opening portion of the collection introduces Santiago el Mayor, who receives a divine commission to intercede with God for the betterment of Spain. During a celestial meeting with God and the Virgin Mary, Santiago expresses his desire for the people of Spain to obtain \"common sense\" amid their grievances. He is then granted the power to perform miracles as he travels back to Earth, where he encounters the reality of everyday life in Spain, including absurd bureaucratic practices and human folly. The narrative sets a tone of both humor and critique, as Santiago navigates the challenges of helping the people while grappling with their inherent resistance to change and understanding.
