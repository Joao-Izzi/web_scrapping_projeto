    "resumo": "\"The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin\" by Beatrix Potter is a children's storybook written in the early 20th century. The book follows the mischievous antics of a young squirrel named Nutkin as he interacts with Old Brown, the owl who inhabits Owl Island. The narrative is steeped in whimsical illustrations and playful rhymes, typical of Potter's storytelling style.  In the story, Nutkin and his fellow squirrels venture to Owl Island to gather nuts. While his cousins exhibit polite behavior and offer gifts to Old Brown, Nutkin’s impudent antics—characterized by riddles and song—irritate the owl, who prefers the courtesy shown by the other squirrels. Despite his impertinence, Nutkin's curiosity leads him into trouble when he dances on Old Brown, resulting in his capture. However, through a clever escape, Nutkin survives to continue his playful nature, forever taunting his friends and any who dare to challenge him with riddles. The story emphasizes themes of respect and consequence, all while enchanting readers with its lively storytelling and charming illustrations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
