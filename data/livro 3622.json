    "resumo": "\"A History of Architecture in All Countries, Volume 1, 3rd ed.\" by James Fergusson is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of architectural styles throughout history, examining structures from ancient civilizations to the present day. The book aims to detail the evolution and significance of architecture across various cultures, offering insights into the artistic and technical developments that have shaped built environments.  The opening of this volume introduces the reader to the methodology and scope of the work. Fergusson distinguishes between two approaches to studying architecture: a static scientific perspective and a historical narrative that traces the origins and influences of architectural forms. He emphasizes the latter as a means to understand not just the art of architecture but its ethnographic significance, asserting that architecture serves as a record of human aspirations across different races and eras. This foundation sets the stage for a detailed examination of ancient architectural styles, beginning with Egyptian architecture, as well as the intellectual and aesthetic values attributed to various architectural accomplishments throughout history.
