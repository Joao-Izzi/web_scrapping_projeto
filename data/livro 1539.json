The story centers around a young woman named Colette dâ€™Erlange, who grapples with her isolation and the constraints imposed by her life in a secluded manor.

The opening of the narrative introduces Colette's deep sense of loneliness as she copes with being trapped in her home by heavy snow. Throughout her musings, she expresses a desire for companionship and excitement, reminiscing about the beauty of nature and her dreams of being rescued from her solitude. As she observes the quiet of her solitary existence, she yearns for the arrival of an adventure or a hero to alleviate her ennui. The sense of isolation continues to build, hinting that Colette's journey toward change and self-discovery will unfold as she engages with her thoughts and prayers, eventually leading her to seek guidance from the mysterious mother Lancien.
