    "resumo": "\"Pinocchio in Africa\" by Eugenio Cherubini is a fictional adventure that draws inspiration from the classic tale of Pinocchio, written in the early 20th century. The story chronicles the escapades of Pinocchio, a wooden marionette, as he embarks on an adventurous journey to Africa, leaving behind his traditional schooling for a world full of wild animals, exotic landscapes, and unexpected challenges. As he pursues wealth and the thrill of adventure, readers are treated to a whimsical narrative that maintains the charm and moral undertones of the original Pinocchio story.  The opening portion of the book introduces Pinocchio's initial ambition to study, which quickly falls by the wayside when he is captivated by the arrival of a circus in town. Ignoring his homework, he is drawn into the vibrant and chaotic spectacle of the circus, mingling with exotic performers and animals. Through his fascination, Pinocchio decides to set off for Africa in search of riches, somewhat naively driven by the fantastical tales he hears. His initial encounters with the circus and his contemplation of adventure set the stage for a journey filled with wild experiences, hinting at the mixture of mischief and life lessons that will come as he navigates African adventures.
