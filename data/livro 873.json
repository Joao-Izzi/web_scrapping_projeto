    "resumo": "\"Men Called Him Master\" by Elwyn A. Smith is a fictional narrative written in the mid-20th century. The book explores the life and teachings of Jesus Christ through the perspectives of his disciples, especially focusing on the significant events in their lives during his ministry. It aims to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the historical and cultural context of Jesus' time and the remarkable transformation of his followers.  The opening of the book introduces us to the world of Jesus and his disciples, specifically emphasizing the curiosity and questions surrounding their experiences with him. The narrative begins with Andrew and John, two of Jesus' disciples, making their way to see John the Baptizer while engaged in a struggle with a heavy load, which metaphorically reflects the burdens they carry in seeking truth. We see glimpses of the socio-political climate of the time through their conversations, including their excitement over John's teachings and their frustrations about Roman oppression. As they encounter various characters and revealing dialogue, readers start to grasp the complexities of the disciples' journeys and their evolving relationship with Jesus, who is depicted as a powerful figure of authority with messages of repentance and love.
