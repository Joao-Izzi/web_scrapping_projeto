    "resumo": "\"Psmith in the City\" by P. G. Wodehouse is a humorous novel written during the early 20th century. The book follows the misadventures of Mike Jackson, a young man who is thrust into the world of commerce and banking after a sudden financial crisis forces him to abandon his plans for university. Alongside him is Psmith, a witty and charming character who adopts a carefree approach to life and is determined to navigate the complexities of the City with style and panache.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Mike Jackson during a cricket match where he suffers an unfortunate dismissal due to the interruption of Mr. John Bickersdyke, a prominent figure in Mike's future. It hints at a tense and amusing rivalry as Mike learns more about his new life in the City. As Mike is pushed into a career at the New Asiatic Bank, he quickly discovers that the business world is far from his expectations. Psmith, already a familiar character from Wodehouse's previous works, enters the scene and soon becomes Mike's ally. Their relationship, full of witty banter and cunning plans, sets the tone for the whimsical journey into the often absurd and chaotic realities of banking and the self-satisfied personalities that inhabit it.
