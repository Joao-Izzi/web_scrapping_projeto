    "resumo": "\"Del governo della peste e della maniera di guardarsene\" by Lodovico Antonio Muratori is a treatise on the governance and management of plague written in the early 18th century. This work addresses the measures that could be taken to mitigate the effects of plague, examining the political, medical, and ecclesiastical responses necessary for public health crises. The author aims to provide practical guidance for communities on how to prepare for and react to outbreaks of the disease, which has historically had devastating impacts on populations.  At the start of the treatise, Muratori introduces the significant fear and concern incited by the plague that threatened Italy in the early 18th century, specifically noting the alarms raised in the city of Modena. He reflects on the historical context of pandemics, detailing past occurrences of plague and the societal ramifications they wrought, such as depopulation and widespread panic. Muratori underscores the necessity of preparation and preventive measures, suggesting that both spiritual and temporal strategies are essential in combating such a scourge. He emphasizes the importance of knowledgeable governance and collective action to ensure the safety of the populace, setting the stage for a thorough exploration of plague management in the chapters to come.
