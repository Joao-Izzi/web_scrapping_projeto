    "resumo": "\"Stray Pearls: Memoirs of Margaret De Ribaumont, Viscountess of Bellaise\" by Charlotte Yonge is a historical novel likely written in the late 19th century. The narrative revolves around Margaret, the daughter of a feudal lord, who transitions from her English upbringing to the complexities of life in France amidst political turmoil and the shifting tides of society during the Fronde.   The opening of the memoir introduces Margaret as she reflects on her past, specifically her childhood in England, her family dynamics, and her eventual marriage arranged by her mother. As she prepares to attend her first ball at Whitehall, she experiences trepidation about marrying a man she perceives to be much older than herself, only to discover that her intended spouse is in fact a very young viscount, Gaspard de Bellaise. The narrative depicts her anxieties as she navigates her identity between English customs and her new life in France, foreshadowing the trials and tribulations she will face as she contemplates her family legacy and societal expectations in a foreign land.
