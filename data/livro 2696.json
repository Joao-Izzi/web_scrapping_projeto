    "resumo": "\"Infelice\" by Augusta J. Evans is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds in a small town, largely centered around a mysterious young woman, Minnie Merle (now claiming to be Mrs. Laurance), who arrives at the parsonage of Dr. Peyton Hargrove seeking the marriage license he once held, which symbolizes her claim to a legitimate identity and her child. The overarching themes explore the entangled relationships and social standing of women in the face of familial and societal pressures, as well as the struggles for identity and justice.  The opening of the book introduces a stormy January night when Minnie Merle, veiled and troubled, visits Dr. Hargrove’s home. She reveals her connection to him through a past marriage ceremony he performed, expressing distress over the lack of recognition she faces from her husband and his family. As Mrs. Hargrove listens, she empathizes with Minnie’s sorrow while observing her reticence regarding the details of her life. The chapter concludes with Dr. Hargrove grappling with the implications of Minnie’s claims and the mystery surrounding her situation, setting the stage for a narrative steeped in intrigue and emotional depth.
