    "resumo": "\"Merisusi\" by Jack London is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story begins with a focus on the main character, who reflects on a fateful trip across San Francisco Bay aboard the ship named \"Martinez\". The opening scene introduces an engaging mix of philosophical musings and tense maritime situations that hint at the impending disaster the protagonist will face.  The beginning of the narrative unfolds as the main character recounts his journey to visit a friend, Charley Furuseth, and the atmospheric tension aboard the ship as it encounters a heavy fog. The protagonist’s observations reveal his thoughts on the division of labor at sea, leading to a sudden and horrific ship collision that culminates in chaos and panic among the passengers. As the \"Martinez\" begins to sink, a vivid depiction of survival instinct emerges, along with the protagonist's desperate struggle in frigid waters, foreshadowing the harsh realities he will confront in the days to come. The collision not only sets the stage for the ensuing survival narrative but also challenges the main character’s sense of self and resilience, hinting at deeper themes of human nature and moral complexity to be explored throughout the novel.
