    "resumo": "\"Fausto: Primera parte\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a dramatic tragedy written in the late 18th to early 19th centuries. The work centers around the character of Dr. Faustus, a scholar who becomes dissatisfied with his life and knowledge, leading him to make a pact with the devil in pursuit of greater understanding and fulfillment. This ambitious narrative delves into themes of ambition, knowledge, and the human condition, which remain relevant today.  At the start of the narrative, we meet Dr. Faustus, who is deeply frustrated despite his extensive academic knowledge in various fields such as philosophy, law, medicine, and theology. He feels that his studies have led him to a point of despair where he knows nothing of true importance. This disillusionment drives him to seek out magic in hopes of accessing higher spiritual truths. In his turmoil, he contemplates the futility of his endeavors, setting the stage for the profound existential themes that underpin the entire work, particularly his ensuing deal with Mephistopheles, the devil.
