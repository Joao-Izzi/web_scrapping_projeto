    "resumo": "\"Happiness as Found in Forethought Minus Fearthought\" by Horace Fletcher is a philosophical treatise written in the late 19th century. The work explores the concepts of happiness, fear, and the importance of cultivating a positive mindset through the elimination of negative thoughts. Fletcher argues that understanding and improving one's mental habits can lead to true happiness, which he describes as a result of conscious usefulness and personal growth.  The opening of the text introduces the central idea that everyone desires to be happy, and highlights the pervasive nature of fear in human experience. Fletcher shares personal anecdotes, emphasizing that happiness can be achieved through changing oneâ€™s mindset and behaviors. He discusses the duality of forethought (positive thinking) and fearthought (negative thinking), asserting that the latter can detract from growth and well-being. As he sets the stage for presenting methods to enhance happiness and eliminate fear, he draws upon historical and personal experiences to illustrate how individuals can cultivate a more harmonious and fulfilled life.
