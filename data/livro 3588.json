    "resumo": "\"Virginia\" by Ellen Glasgow is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in the post-Civil War South, focusing on the life of Virginia Pendleton and her experiences as she navigates her way through the challenges of womanhood, societal expectations, and her burgeoning feelings for the returning Oliver Treadwell. The narrative delves into themes of personal growth, societal change, and the conflict between tradition and modernity.  At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to the quaint town of Dinwiddie in Virginia during the year 1884. The opening chapter focuses on Miss Priscilla Batte, a teacher at a local academy, and her interactions with two young girls, Virginia Pendleton and Susan Treadwell. The girls exhibit the innocence and excitement of youth as they discuss the return of Oliver, Susan's cousin. Virginia is portrayed as a beautiful and spirited young woman, full of hope and curiosity about the future. During their conversation, Oliver's character is foreshadowed through discussions about his idealism and aspirations as a writer, which sets the stage for Virginia's growing interest in him. The narrative reflects both the external charm of Dinwiddie and the internal struggles of its characters, creating a rich context for the evolution of Virginia's identity against the backdrop of a transforming South.
