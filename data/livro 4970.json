    "resumo": "\"Avarice--Anger: Two of the Seven Cardinal Sins\" by Eugène Sue is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative begins in Paris, where the plight of a young girl named Mariette is introduced as she struggles with poverty and personal devotion to her godmother, Madame Lacombe, who is chronically ill. The story explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the struggles against societal injustice, particularly highlighted through Mariette's relationship with her lover, Louis, and the moral dilemmas they face.  The opening of the novel establishes Mariette as a compassionate and hardworking young woman who takes care of her invalid godmother, sacrificing her own needs for that of her family. As she navigates this difficult life, she writes a heartfelt letter to Louis, in which unexpressed anxieties about their future hint at the challenges ahead. The scrivener, who assists Mariette in her correspondence, becomes concerned over the nature of her relationship with Louis upon realizing the implications of their connection. The dynamic between Mariette, her godmother’s bitterness, and the societal pressures they face lays the groundwork for deeper explorations of human relationships and the temptations of wealth and passion. This opening portion foreshadows potential conflicts rooted in love and moral choices, situating the reader for a poignant exploration of the cardinal sins of avarice and anger.
