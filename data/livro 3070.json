    "resumo": "\"Eye Service and Love Service\" by Anonymous is a moral tale likely written during the late 19th century. This book exemplifies a brief narrative that imparts lessons on the values of sincerity and integrity in service, contrasting two types of behaviors: serving out of obligation when being watched (eye service) versus serving out of love and genuine intent (love service). Its simplistic style and didactic purpose suggest it targets a young audience, aiming to instill moral values through relatable characters and scenarios.  The story revolves around two young sisters, Bessie and Meggie, who are tasked with caring for their cottage and baby brother while their mother is away. During their time alone, they resist the temptation to neglect their responsibilities despite the influence of a neighbor, Jenny, who represents the opposite of their values. Throughout their endeavors, they choose to act with love and respect for their mother's wishes, highlighting the importance of character and conscientiousness. In contrast, Jenny's careless attitude leads her to disregard her motherâ€™s expectations, resulting in negative consequences. Ultimately, the story celebrates love service over eye service, reinforcing the notion that true care and commitment are rooted in love rather than mere compliance.
