    "resumo": "\"The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Vol 1 (of 2)\" by Coleridge is a collection of poems and dramatic works written in the late 19th century. This volume presents an extensive compilation of Coleridge's poetry, including pieces that are being published for the first time, and offers insights into the poet's creative process and literary evolution. It is aimed at both general readers interested in Coleridge's work and scholars seeking a comprehensive textual analysis of his contributions to literature.  At the start of this collection, the preface sets the stage for the included works, detailing the challenges and efforts made to gather and present Coleridgeâ€™s poetry accurately. The opening section introduces the poem \"Easter Holidays,\" capturing the joys of spring and youthful exuberance while foreshadowing the inevitable sorrows of life. As the initial verses unfold, themes of joy, beauty, love, and the harsh realities of human existence begin to emerge, reflecting the complex emotional landscape that runs throughout Coleridge's poetic journey. The tone is both reflective and celebratory, preparing the reader for the depth and variety in the subsequent poems included in this rich anthology. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
