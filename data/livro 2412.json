    "resumo": "\"Roughing It, Part 8\" by Mark Twain is a travel narrative written in the late 19th century. This portion of the work continues to explore Twain's adventures, specifically focusing on his observations and experiences in the Hawaiian Islands. In this section, Twain reflects on historical events, such as Captain Cook's assassination and cultural elements of the native Hawaiian people, while also capturing the beauty of the landscape, including the dramatic features of the islands themselves and the destructiveness of volcanic activity.  The opening of this section describes Twain and his companions traveling down a desolate lava mountain towards Kealakekua Bay, a historic site associated with Captain Cook. He vividly recounts the haunting scenery and historical significance of the area, reminiscing about past events and the cultural practices of the Kanakas (Hawaiians). Twainâ€™s writing style combines humor with sharp observations on human nature, presenting a commentary on colonialism and the affects of Western culture on native populations, while emphasizing his candid admiration for the islands' natural beauty.
