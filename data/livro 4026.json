This work captures a rich tapestry of local legends, saints, and their miraculous deeds, aiming to preserve the oral narratives that characterize the region's cultural identity. The tales feature various saints, each embodying distinct virtues or lessons intertwined with the natural landscape of Cornwall.  The opening of the collection introduces a theme of nostalgia for the past, noting that storytelling around the fire was once a common practice that has faded with time.

This portion includes the legends of different saints in Cornwall, such as St. Just and St. Keverne, highlighting their miraculous feats and the moral lessons embedded in their stories. Each legend serves to illustrate the blend of Christianity and local beliefs, showcasing how historical and supernatural elements intertwine in the lives of these saints, captivating the reader's imagination with a sense of belonging to this mystical past.
