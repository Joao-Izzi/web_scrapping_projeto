    "resumo": "\"Round the Corner in Gay Street\" by Grace S. Richmond is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the interactions and relationships of families living in a suburban neighborhood, particularly highlighting the lives of the Townsend and Bell families. As the narrative unfolds, the characters navigate social dynamics and personal challenges, providing a glimpse into their daily lives and aspirations.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the Townsend family during breakfast, where we meet the sickly Murray, his spirited sister Olive, and the athletic Forrest. Their quiet morning routine is disrupted by the arrival of new neighbors—the Bells—who have just moved into a small house across Gay Street. Murray is drawn to the lively girls observing him from the porch, leading to the serendipitous meeting with Jane Bell later on. The opening chapters establish a backdrop of contrasting family dynamics and the beginnings of friendships, setting the stage for the interactions that will evolve between the characters in their close-knit community.
