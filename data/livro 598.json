    "resumo": "\"The Chemically Pure Warriors\" by Allen Kim Lang is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. The story revolves around Lieutenant Lee Hartford and his platoon, who occupy a planet known as Kansas, inhabited by Indigenous Hominids they deem \"Stinkers.\" The narrative delves into the complexities of inter-species interactions, ethical dilemmas surrounding occupation, and the consequences of colonial attitudes as Hartford grapples with both his mission and the cost of war.  At the start of the book, the regiment, consisting of Hartford's \"Terrible Third,\" is returning to their barracks after a prolonged field exercise. Their routines highlight the heavy reliance on sterile safety suits, as their species, chemically pure Axenites, lack immunity to Earth bacteria. Amidst the camaraderie and banter of the soldiers, tension simmers beneath the surface regarding their treatment of the native population. Then, after a series of events, Lieutenant Piacentelli seeks to make contact with the locals, leading to tragic outcomes that spark a violent response from the colonel commanding Hartford, raising questions about morality, duty, and the dark purpose behind their mission on an alien world.
