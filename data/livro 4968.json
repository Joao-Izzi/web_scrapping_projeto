    "resumo": "\"The Day of Doom; Or, A Poetical Description of the Great and Last Judgment\" by Michael Wigglesworth is a religious poem written in the 17th century. This work presents a vivid and dramatic portrayal of the Last Judgment, exploring themes of sin, redemption, and divine justice. The poem resonates with the theological perspectives of the Puritan era, emphasizing the consequences of human actions in the afterlife.  The opening of this poem sets a somber and atmospheric scene, describing a tranquil night abruptly disrupted by the terrifying arrival of Christ as the Judge. As people sleep in their complacency, unaware of the impending doom, the narrative builds tension, detailing how hearts tremble and panic ensues at the sight of the divine. The judicious separation of the righteous from the wicked and the ensuing pleas for mercy highlight the moral dilemmas faced by individuals, culminating in a powerful reminder of their fate. Wigglesworth uses rich imagery and strong emotional appeal to confront readers with the weight of their choices, foreshadowing the dramatic events of the Judgment Day.
