    "resumo": "\"The King's Own Borderers: A Military Romance, Volume 3 (of 3)\" by James Grant is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. The story follows Quentin Kennedy, a young British soldier, as he navigates the complexities of war, honor, and love during the Peninsular War, particularly in a tumultuous romance with a Spanish girl named Donna Isidora de Saldos. As Quentin grapples with his feelings for Isidora while remaining pained by memories of a lost love in England, the narrative unfolds against a backdrop of military conflict and intrigue.  The opening portion of the book sets the stage for an intense period of waiting and budding romance as Quentin and Isidora find themselves trapped in a villa due to incessant rain. Their confined circumstances serve to ignite a passionate connection, complicating Quentin's thoughts about Flora Warrender, the girl he left behind. Tension builds as Isidora's feelings for Quentin become increasingly evident, prompting her to consider desperate measures to secure his affections, including the use of a poisonous wine. This chaotic mix of unfulfilled love, loyalty, and deception lays the groundwork for an emotionally charged adventure that intertwines personal stakes with the broader conflicts of the time.
