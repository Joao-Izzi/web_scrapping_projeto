    "resumo": "\"Det går an\" by C. J. L. Almqvist is a novel written during the early 19th century. The narrative begins by introducing us to a lively scene at Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm, where a mix of townsfolk and travelers are rushing to board an outbound steamboat. Central to the story are two characters: a sergeant who is intrigued by a beautiful young woman named Sara Videbeck, the daughter of a glassmaker from Lidköping, who becomes separated from her aunt during the commotion of boarding.  The opening of the novel immerses readers in a bustling summer morning, showcasing the social dynamics among the passengers on the steamboat. The sergeant’s observations lead him to wonder about Sara's origins and status, and as he engages with her, the narrative hints at both social class distinctions and human connections. Their interactions reveal a blossoming companionship, marked by humor and misunderstandings, set against the backdrop of travel and societal expectations. The scene is rich with character development and gives a glimpse into their differing worlds, creating a compelling start to their journey together. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
