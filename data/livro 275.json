    "resumo": "\"Original Short Stories — Volume 01\" by Guy de Maupassant is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The book showcases Maupassant's signature style, which often weaves themes of human behavior, society, and the consequences of war into compelling narratives. It opens with a detailed introduction that touches on the author's life and literary debut, setting the stage for the profound exploration of character and morality that the stories will deliver.  At the start of the collection, the opening portion provides a comprehensive insight into Maupassant's background and the context of his literary emergence, particularly focusing on the story \"Boule de Suif,\" which serves as a critical commentary on social attitudes during the Franco-Prussian War. The narrative introduces a group of passengers from different social classes who are forced to travel together during this troubled time. Among them is Boule de Suif, a courtesan whose actions trigger moral dilemmas and reveal the hypocrisy of her companions. Through rich character descriptions and a suspenseful storyline, the beginning of the book sets the tone for the themes of hypocrisy, social class dynamics, and human resilience that permeate the subsequent stories.
