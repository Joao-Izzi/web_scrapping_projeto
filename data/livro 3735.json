    "resumo": "\"The Percheron Horse\" by Charles Du Hays is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work examines the Percheron breed of horses, detailing its characteristics, breeding methods, and historical context. The book likely appeals to horse enthusiasts, breeders, and those interested in agricultural advancements focusing on the Percheron’s renowned qualities as a draft horse.  The opening of the text sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of the Percheron horse, deliberately establishing the breed’s significance and its attributes of strength, docility, and suitability for hard work. The author describes the horse's physical traits, such as its typical gray coat and well-proportioned body, which contribute to its endurance and performance. Du Hays expresses concern over the breed's decline due to high demand and the introduction of foreign bloodlines, advocating for careful breeding methods to preserve and improve the Percheron’s purity and utility. The initial chapters serve to introduce the cultural and geographical backdrop of the Percheron, hinting at both its historical roots and potential future developments in breeding practices.
