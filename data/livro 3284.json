    "resumo": "\"Entwurf einer neuen Ästhetik der Tonkunst\" by Ferruccio Busoni is a philosophical treatise on music aesthetics written in the early 20th century. This book explores the nature of music, its significance as an art form, and the developing role of composers and musicians within it. The text delves into the essence of musical expression, advocating for a deeper understanding and appreciation of music beyond conventional frameworks.  In this work, Busoni articulates a vision of music as a free and dynamic art form that transcends rigid structures and norms. He challenges the prevalent distinctions between \"absolute\" and \"program\" music, arguing instead for a unity that reflects the profound emotional and spiritual experiences that music can convey. Busoni believes that true musical creation should not be confined to existing traditions or forms, advocating for innovation and exploration in composition. Throughout the book, he illustrates his ideas by referencing great composers, emphasizing the need to liberate music from limiting conventions and encouraging a more intuitive connection with its essence.
