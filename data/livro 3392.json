    "resumo": "\"Orrain: A Romance\" by S. Levett Yeats is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Bertrand d'Orrain, the son of Ren√©, Vidame d'Orrain. He navigates political intrigue, family rivalry, and personal transformation as he confronts his bitter step-brother Simon and the forces of the court, particularly under the watchful eye of Catherine de Medicis.   At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to the fraught family dynamics, with Bertrand reflecting on his relationships and experiences that have led him to his current predicament. Following the deaths in his family, he faces rejection from his step-brother and is forced into a life of exile with aspirations of reclaiming his title and land. In a series of dramatic confrontations, including a chance meeting where he saves a nobleman under attack, Bertrand begins his journey of reclaiming his past while struggling against the machinations of his enemies and the shadow of his family's legacy. The opening sets the stage for a tale filled with action, romance, and the quest for identity amidst a backdrop of political strife. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
