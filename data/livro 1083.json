    "resumo": "\"All He Knew: A Story\" by John Habberton is a novel written during the late 19th century. The book centers around Sam Kimper, an ex-convict who has just been released from prison and returns to his family in the struggling rural town of Bruceton. Through Sam's journey, the story explores themes of redemption, the struggle for dignity, and the challenges of reintegration into society after serving time for a crime.  At the start of the story, we are introduced to Sam Kimper as he steps off the train, carrying the burden of his past and a longing to make amends. His initial interactions with former acquaintances hint at the stigma associated with his incarceration. He encounters his children and wife, each struggling with their own hardships, and vows to improve their lives while grappling with the repercussions of his previous lifestyle. The opening chapters set the stage for Sam's inner conflict between his past choices and his aspirations for a better future, alongside the challenges presented by his family's dynamics and societal perceptions.
