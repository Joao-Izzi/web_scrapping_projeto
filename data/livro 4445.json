    "resumo": "\"The Heart's Domain\" by Georges Duhamel is a philosophical essay written in the early 20th century. The work contemplates the concept of happiness, arguing that it is the ultimate goal of human existence, despite the pervasive suffering in the world, particularly during the tumultuous times of war. Through the author's introspective reflection, he seeks to ignite a reevaluation of what true happiness means and how it can be pursued in a world marred by conflict and despair.  At the start of the essay, Duhamel sets the stage by acknowledging the existential crisis that many faced during the war. He highlights the overwhelming focus on misery and despair that seemed to engulf society and suggests that rather than succumbing to this gloom, individuals should turn their gaze internally to discover the enduring light of their inner lives. The author discusses the fleeting and external nature of pleasure in contrast to the deep, enduring happiness that comes from understanding and possessing one's inner self. This theme of finding joy amidst chaos unfolds as he emphasizes the importance of human connection, personal introspection, and the search for meaningful existence, challenging readers to engage in heartfelt contemplation of their own aspirations for happiness.
