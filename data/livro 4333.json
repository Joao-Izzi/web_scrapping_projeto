The narrative explores the dynamics of the imperial court and offers insights into the personalities and events surrounding Josephine and Napoleon Bonaparte.  The opening of this memoir sets the stage by introducing the author’s background and her close connections with key figures of the era, particularly Josephine and Napoleon. It details Madame de Rémusat's ascent at court following her marriage, her family's turbulent history during the Revolution, and her subsequent loyalty to Empress Josephine amidst the shifts in power. Through her eyes, readers begin to witness the complexities of court life, nuances of personal relationships, and the atmosphere of early 19th-century France, particularly as it evolves with the establishing of the Empire and its implications for all involved.
