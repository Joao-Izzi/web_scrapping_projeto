    "resumo": "\"The Collected Works of Henrik Ibsen, Vol. 02 (of 11)\" by Henrik Ibsen is a collection of plays written in the mid-19th century. This volume includes the two dramatic works \"The Vikings at Helgeland\" and \"The Pretenders.\" The themes explore complex character dynamics, societal roles, and the interplay between personal ambition and moral responsibility against the backdrop of Norse tradition and mythology.  At the start of \"The Vikings at Helgeland,\" the characters are introduced amidst a tense encounter between the Viking Sigurd and the Icelandic chieftain Örnulf. The scene sets a dramatic tone with promises of peace contrasting the potential for conflict over past grievances. Sigurd's fierce loyalty to his foster-brother Gunnar and his wife Dagny weaves a complex web of relationships that hint at future tensions, especially with the strong-willed Hiördis, Örnulf's foster-daughter. The opening also hints at underlying themes of vengeance, honor, and the consequences of past actions as characters navigate personal and familial bonds in a harsh, mythic landscape.
