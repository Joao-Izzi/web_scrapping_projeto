    "resumo": "\"A Counterfeit Presentment; and The Parlour Car\" by William Dean Howells is a play written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds primarily through the interactions of two young men, Bartlett and Cummings, in the parlour of the Ponkwasset Hotel on a beautiful September day. Central to the drama is Bartlett's personality and the implications of a striking resemblance to a man who has caused great emotional pain to a family associated with the hotel.  The opening of the narrative introduces two young artists, Bartlett and Cummings, as they arrive at the hotel, laden with painting supplies. The dialogue quickly reveals Bartlett's brusque demeanor and longing for solitude away from the bustling city, juxtaposed with Cummings' more sensitive disposition. Their discussion touches upon beauty, artistic aspirations, and the contrasting fates of women when faced with betrayal, a theme that becomes pivotal as they discover a lady's belongings in the room, hinting at impending complications. Soon, the tension escalates when General Wyatt enters, mistaking Bartlett for the man who devastated his daughter, leading to a series of misunderstandings that set the stage for exploring themes of identity, guilt, and social facades.
