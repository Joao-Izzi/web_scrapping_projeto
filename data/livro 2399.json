    "resumo": "\"The Dream\" by H. G. Wells is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Harry Mortimer Smith and his exploration of life through vivid and strange dreams that intertwine realities, revealing experiences and insights from his past and potentially other lives. The narrative hints at deeper themes such as the nature of existence, the aftereffects of societal collapse, and the essence of human relationships through the eyes of the main character.  The opening of the novel introduces the character Sarnac, who is embarking on a holiday with his companion, Sunray, after a long period of intense work on chemical reactions in the nervous system. As they traverse lakes and mountains, they meet other interesting travelers and engage in discussions that reflect on the tragedies of past wars. Their excursion leads them to ancient ruins, evoking strong memories of loss and death. Sarnac's thoughts during these experiences begin to blur the line between his present reality and a vivid dream of a past life, where he recalls his identity as Harry Mortimer Smith, blurring both the timeline and the essence of self. This foreshadows a deeper journey into memory and existence as the plot unfolds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
