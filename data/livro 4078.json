    "resumo": "\"Medical Sketches of the Expedition to Egypt, from India\" by Sir James McGrigor is a historical account written in the early 19th century. The work presents a detailed examination of the medical circumstances surrounding a military expedition from India to Egypt, with a focus on the diseases that plagued the Indian Army during this campaign. McGrigor, serving as the Superintending Surgeon to the Indian Army in Egypt, compiles findings from his experiences, medical reports, and correspondence with fellow medical officers.  At the start of the book, McGrigor introduces the context of his medical sketches, outlining his duties to provide an account of the health challenges faced by troops during their expedition. He emphasizes the importance of accuracy over speculation, indicating that his observations are grounded in concrete reports and facts. The opening also describes the factors contributing to the soldiers' health, including the effects of the local climate, the nature of the diseases encountered, and the responses of the military medical staff. McGrigor's tone is meticulous, reflecting a deep commitment to documenting the realities and challenges faced by the troops, as well as a desire to learn from these experiences for future military medical practices.
