The story is set in the whimsical Land of Oz and revolves around the misadventures of Grampa, an old soldier; Prince Tatters; and a weather cock named Bill as they embark on a quest to find King Fumbo's lost head and seek fortune.

The opening of \"Grampa in Oz\" introduces readers to the Kingdom of Ragbad, ruled by the hapless King Fumbo, who has inadvertently lost his head during a storm. Grampa, the courageous old soldier, along with Prince Tatters and the comical weather cock Bill, are soon drawn into a chaotic series of events to solve their Kingâ€™s predicament. As they begin their journey, the narrative unfolds with rich character development, whimsical mishaps, and a promise of adventure tinged with the trademark charm of Oz. The trio's humorous interactions and the peculiar challenges they face set the stage for an engaging quest filled with magic and unexpected surprises. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
