    "resumo": "\"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught\" by Joshua Rose is a practical instructional manual written in the late 19th century. The book serves as a self-learning guide aimed at beginners in mechanical drawing, providing insights into the selection and use of drawing instruments, along with fundamental principles of geometry and mechanical design. The focus is on hands-on examples that machinists encounter in their daily work, making it highly applicable for those seeking to develop their skills in this field.  The opening of the text outlines the authorâ€™s purpose of empowering novices to create mechanical drawings independently, without requiring an instructor's guidance. It explains specialized techniques such as the detailed step-by-step processes for using drawing tools, emphasizing the importance of practicing with smaller drawings to build skill and confidence. Rose effectively underscores that familiarity with drawing instruments is the key to mastering mechanical drawing, preparing the reader for the practical examples that follow throughout the work.
