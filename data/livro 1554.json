    "resumo": "\"Pan\" by Knut Hamsun is a novel written in the late 19th century. The book revolves around the introspective thoughts of its main character, Lieutenant Tuomas Glahn, as he reflects on his life and experiences in the Norwegian wilderness, including his relationships and the beauty of nature around him.  At the start of the novel, Lieutenant Glahn contemplates the summer days in Norway, reminiscing about his solitary life in a cabin surrounded by nature. He recounts past encounters, particularly with a group of people who unexpectedly visit him during a rainstorm, introducing Edvarda, a young woman who piques his interest. As he navigates his solitary existence filled with hunting and reflections, the early chapters set the tone for Glahn's inner struggles and the unfolding of his feelings for Edvarda amidst the serene yet wild landscapes he inhabits.
