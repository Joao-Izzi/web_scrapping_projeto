    "resumo": "\"More Celtic Fairy Tales\" by Joseph Jacobs is a collection of folklore stories written in the late 19th century. This anthology serves as a continuation of Jacobs' efforts to preserve Celtic cultural narratives, particularly emphasizing fairy tales from the British Isles, including tales from both Ireland and Scotland. The collection features renowned stories such as \"The Fate of the Children of Lir,\" which explores themes of transformation and perseverance through the trials faced by its characters.  At the start of the collection, the opening tale introduces readers to the tragic and enchanting story of \"The Fate of the Children of Lir.\" It recounts the significance of familial bonds and the repercussions of jealousy as Lir's children are transformed into swans due to their stepmother's dark magic. As they navigate their new existence, the children retain their voices, lamenting their fate while longing for freedom. This opening portion sets a tone steeped in rich mythology and emotional resonance, suggesting that the collection will offer a blend of enchanting narratives filled with moral undertones and cultural significance.
