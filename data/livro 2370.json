The work features contributions from fourteen American authors and highlights various perspectives on the political landscape of the time, particularly focusing on the contentious issue of woman suffrage. The narrative unfolds primarily through the lives of its characters, including George Remington, a politically ambitious young lawyer, his wife Genevieve, and Betty Sheridan, an ardent suffragist.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Genevieve Remington as she navigates her new life as a wife to George, who is a candidate for District Attorney. George's political career begins to conflict with their personal lives, especially as the suffrage movement gains momentum. The story sets the stage for tensions and interactions among characters that embody the societal divide over women's rights, showcasing Genevieve's support for her husband while grappling with the implications of his staunch opposition to suffrage. As the narrative progresses, elements of familial expectations, personal ambition, and social activism intertwine, making it clear that the characters will face complex challenges related to the emerging feminist discourse in their community.
