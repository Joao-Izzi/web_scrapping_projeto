    "resumo": "\"The Tower\" by W. B. Yeats is a collection of poems written during the early 20th century. The book features Yeats' exploration of themes such as aging, beauty, and the pursuit of artistic and personal identity. Through his verses, Yeats reflects on the passage of time and the complexities of human experience, often intermingling personal introspections with broader cultural and historical observations.  The book consists of several significant poems, including the renowned \"Sailing to Byzantium\" and \"Meditations in Time of Civil War.\" In these poems, Yeats grapples with the inevitability of aging and the longing for transcendence in art and spirituality. He invokes rich imagery and classical references to evoke a sense of nostalgia and an existential quest for meaning. The poems often highlight the tension between the physical decay of old age and the unyielding vigor of artistic imagination, leaving readers to contemplate the interplay between life and death, memory and oblivion. Overall, \"The Tower\" is a deeply philosophical and emotional journey through the nuances of life, art, and the search for enduring truths. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
