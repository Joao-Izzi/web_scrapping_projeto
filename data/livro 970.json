    "resumo": "\"Caesar Dies\" by Talbot Mundy is a historical novel written during the early 20th century. The narrative unfolds in the opulent and politically charged city of Antioch during the reign of the infamous Emperor Commodus, showcasing the intricacies of Roman society, politics, and the looming threat of treachery. The story revolves around Sextus, son of Maximus, and his close friend Norbanus, as they navigate the perilous landscape of power dynamics amid the backdrop of a corrupt empire.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to the vibrant city of Antioch, depicted as a hub of cultural and economic activity, filled with contrasts between its wealthy citizens and their enslaved companions. As Sextus and Norbanus ride towards Daphne, their conversation reveals discontent with Commodus's rule, touching on themes of loyalty, friendship, and the dangers of political dissent. Sextus grapples with his family's status and his own beliefs about honor in a time of tyranny, setting the stage for the conflict that arises from his father's unexpected execution. This opening portion deftly establishes both the richly detailed setting and the character conflicts that promise to drive the drama throughout the work.
