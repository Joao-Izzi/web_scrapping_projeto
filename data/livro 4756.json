    "resumo": "\"The Gateless Barrier\" by Lucas Malet is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Laurence Rivers, a young man who is navigating the complexities of life, love, and societal expectations as he travels to England to visit his ailing uncle. As he confronts the dualities of his existence—his successful yet superficial marriage and the intellectual pursuits that beckon him—Laurence grapples with profound questions about identity, purpose, and the human condition.  The opening of the novel captures Laurence's inner turmoil as he embarks on a solitary voyage, which provides him with a sense of freedom that he has not experienced since his marriage. The narrative introduces a contrast between the vibrant, bustling life he leads in society and the deeper introspections that the sea brings forth. Upon arriving at his uncle's estate, Stoke Rivers, Laurence discovers not only the oppressive atmosphere of the house but also hears unsettling tales about it, setting the stage for the exploration of supernatural elements and moral questions he will encounter. Through his interactions with his enigmatic uncle, who is both intellectually stimulating and critical, Laurence is drawn into a web of existential inquiries that may change the course of his life.
