    "resumo": "\"Seventeen Years in the Underworld\" by Wellington Scott is a personal narrative and autobiographical account written in the early 20th century. The book chronicles the authorâ€™s tumultuous journey through crime, incarceration, and eventual redemption, providing an insight into the life of those who dwell in the underworld of society. The author recounts his early life, the descent into criminal activities, and the challenges encountered in reform schools and prisons, ultimately offering a perspective on the underlying issues of crime and rehabilitation.  At the start of the narrative, Wellington Scott reflects on his childhood marked by a loving yet financially modest family background. After experiencing the loss of his mother and the burden of family caregiving, he struggles with feelings of isolation and a vision impairment that further alienates him from his peers. This discomfort leads him to seek solace in a nearby pool room, where he finds companionship among other boys, but it also introduces him to the seductive allure of gambling and petty crime. The opening chapters lay the groundwork for his gradual descent into a life of crime, detailing the experiences and environmental influences that shape his path toward imprisonment and reform, while foreshadowing the ongoing struggle between morality and the temptations of the underworld.
