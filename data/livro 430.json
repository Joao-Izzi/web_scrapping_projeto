    "resumo": "\"The Tadpoles of Bufo cognatus Say\" by Hobart M. Smith is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. The book focuses on the tadpole stage of the amphibian species Bufo cognatus, providing observations and analyses of their anatomy and behavior. Smith's research contributes to the understanding of amphibian development and taxonomy, particularly in relation to the specific characteristics of this species.  In this publication, Smith presents detailed descriptions and drawings of the mouthparts of Bufo cognatus tadpoles, emphasizing the consistency of these features across different specimens gathered in the field. He highlights the morphological characteristics that differentiate the larvae from other closely related species, suggesting a strong relationship with Bufo compactilis. Notably, Smith also discusses the timing of various developmental stages, such as the appearance of hind and fore legs, and raises questions about the classification of these tadpoles, indicating the need for further comparative studies to clarify their taxonomic status.
