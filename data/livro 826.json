    "resumo": "\"Perheonni\" by graf Leo Tolstoi is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set against the backdrop of a family grappling with the loss of their matriarch, the story revolves around the lives of three siblings, Maria, Katja, and Sonja, as they navigate grief and isolation on their estate. The narrative delves into their relationships and emotional struggles, particularly focusing on Maria, who feels trapped in her sorrow and begins to explore the possibility of love and happiness amidst her family's turmoil.  At the start of the novel, the siblings are mourning their recently deceased mother during a dreary winter at their country estate. The atmosphere is heavy with sadness, and they are isolated, receiving few visitors who also bring reminders of their loss. Maria, the central character, at seventeen years old, wrestles with feelings of hopelessness and despair as she reflects on her life and future without her mother. Despite her melancholy, the arrival of Sergei Michailovitsh, a family friend, introduces a glimpse of warmth and potential change, as Maria grapples with her feelings towards him, contrasting her inner turmoil with newfound hope for a brighter future.
