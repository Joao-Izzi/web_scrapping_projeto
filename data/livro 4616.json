    "resumo": "\"De la littérature des nègres, ou Recherches sur leurs facultés intellectuelles, leurs qualités morales et leur littérature\" by H. Grégoire is a scholarly treatise written in the early 19th century. This work delves into the intellectual capabilities and moral qualities of Black people, aiming to counter prevailing stereotypes and prejudices of the time. It presents a critical analysis of the contributions of individuals of African descent in various fields, thus positioning them within the greater context of human achievement.  The opening of the text establishes the groundwork for a thorough examination of the term \"Nègres\" and its historical context. Grégoire discusses the varied interpretations surrounding the origin of Black people, arguing for an inherent unity among humanity, regardless of skin color. He references ancient writers and modern observations to debunk myths related to racial differences, emphasizing the similarities between races rather than perpetuating notions of inferiority. This sets up the broader themes of the text that challenge racial prejudices and advocate for the recognition of the intellectual and cultural contributions of people of African descent.
