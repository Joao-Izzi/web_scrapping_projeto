    "resumo": "\"The Queen of Hearts\" by Wilkie Collins is a novel written in the mid-19th century, during the Victorian era. The story revolves around the dynamics between three elderly brothers—Owen, Morgan, and Griffith—who live in a secluded tower in South Wales and their unexpected guest, the vibrant and lively young woman named Jessie Yelverton. The introduction presents a contrast between the brothers' somber, solitary lives and Jessie's youthful exuberance, setting the stage for an exploration of relationships, societal expectations, and the interplay between youth and age.  At the start of the novel, the three brothers are portrayed as quiet and somewhat eccentric characters confronting the arrival of Jessie, who is introduced with warmth and exuberance. The narrative begins with a letter of dedication, reflecting Collins's gratitude toward a friend and critic, before moving into the brothers' lives at The Glen Tower. Each brother’s background is explored, highlighting Owen's compassion and gentle nature as a former clergyman, Morgan's blunt and sarcastic disposition as a retired doctor, and Griffith's experiences as a writer and lawyer. The whimsical nature of Jessie's entry into their lives creates a dilemma for the brothers, who are uncertain about how to handle her presence, setting up a myriad of comedic and emotional events that follow as the story unfolds. The interplay of their vastly different personalities leads to humorous and poignant moments as they navigate the complexities of their new dynamic. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
