    "resumo": "\"Bhagavad-Gita: Herrens Sång\" by Hjalmar Johannes Runeberg is a philosophical text rooted in ancient Indian wisdom, written in the early 20th century. This work is a Swedish translation of the renowned scripture that forms part of the Indian epic Mahabharata and serves as a spiritual and ethical guide. The Bhagavad-Gita addresses profound themes of duty, righteousness, and the paths to self-realization, all conveyed through a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna.   At the start of the text, the scene is set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where the hero Arjuna faces a moral crisis as he prepares to fight against his own relatives and friends. Overwhelmed with grief and doubt about his duty as a warrior, he questions the righteousness of the impending conflict. This opening establishes not only the storyline but also the central philosophical conflict, as Krishna begins to impart wisdom about life, the nature of the self, and the importance of fulfilling one’s duty without attachment to the results, a foundational theme that pervades the book.
