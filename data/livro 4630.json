    "resumo": "\"Eline Vere\" by Louis Couperus is a novel written in the late 19th century. The book explores themes of beauty, youth, and societal roles through the life of the main character, Eline Vere, a sensitive and dreamy young woman navigating her relationships and ambitions in a social milieu that often feels stifling and unkind. The narrative offers a richly detailed look at the intricacies of her world, where social expectations clash with personal desires.  The opening of \"Eline Vere\" introduces readers to a vibrant setting of a grand social event where various characters prepare for a tableau performance. Frédérique van Erlevoort, one of the performers, is assisted by Paul van Raat as she readies herself. The atmosphere is filled with excitement and a flurry of activity. Through insightful descriptions, we learn about Eline, who is later revealed as a more introspective character, feeling somewhat isolated due to her melancholic nature and her struggles with identity and purpose. Tender moments are interspersed with observations on the superficiality of social interactions, setting the stage for Eline's deeper emotional journey. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
