    "resumo": "\"Les Peterkins\" by Mark Twain is a humorous fictional work written in the late 19th century. The story follows the quirky Peterkin family as they adjust to their new home and embark on various misadventures, primarily focusing on their enthusiastic but misguided attempts to learn foreign languages for potential travelâ€”but not without hilarity arising from their misunderstandings and interactions.   The beginning of \"Les Peterkins\" introduces the family as they settle into their more spacious new house, filled with hopes for better organization and academic pursuits. Mr. Peterkins encourages each family member to learn a different language, leading to a comical debate about the practicality and methods of doing so. Their conversations are filled with whimsical ideas, misunderstandings about invitations, and the potential chaos of having multiple language professors simultaneously in their home, setting a lighthearted and humorous tone for the unfolding story.
