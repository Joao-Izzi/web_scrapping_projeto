    "resumo": "\"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His Death\" by Horace Waller is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work compiles the journals of explorer David Livingstone, detailing his final years in Africa, particularly his attempts to discover the source of the Nile and to combat the slave trade. The book not only presents Livingstone's geographical and scientific observations but also reflects on his personal struggles, beliefs, and the local cultures he encounters during his travels.  The opening of this historical account establishes the profound impact of Livingstone's death on the exploration community and highlights the significance of the journals that survived, thanks largely to his loyal native attendants, Chuma and Susi. Readers are introduced to the initial stages of Livingstoneâ€™s journey as he arrives in Zanzibar, detailing the reception he receives from the Sultan and the challenges he faces, including difficulties with local transportation, the harsh environment, and the specter of the slave trade. The narrative sets a tone of both adventure and solemnity as it hints at the toll that exploration takes on Livingstone's physical and mental well-being, while also illuminating the complex tapestry of African cultures he interacts with.
