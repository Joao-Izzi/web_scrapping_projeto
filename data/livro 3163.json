    "resumo": "\"Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa\" by Cândido de Figueiredo is a comprehensive dictionary written in the early 20th century. This lexicographic work seeks to compile and standardize Portuguese vocabulary, reflecting contemporary linguistic practices while also incorporating historical and regional terms. The book aims to enrich the language by acknowledging popular and scientific terminology, promoting a unified understanding of Portuguese across different regions and cultures.  The opening of the dictionary outlines the author's motivation for creating a new lexicon and reflects on past dictionaries’ shortcomings. Cândido de Figueiredo criticizes previous works for their lack of completeness and alignment with modern usage, noting that many common and valuable terms, especially from popular and scientific contexts, were missing. He emphasizes the importance of including a diverse array of terms to reflect the richness of the Portuguese language and its evolution, particularly highlighting the lexicon's role in bridging regional dialects and contemporary vocabulary.
