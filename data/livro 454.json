    "resumo": "\"A Trip Abroad\" by Don Carlos Janes is a travel narrative penned in the early 20th century. The book recounts the author's journey through historical and religious sites in Palestine and Egypt, alongside considerations of geography and the history of these significant regions. Janes blends personal reflections and observations with informative content, making the work both engaging and educational for readers interested in travel and religious history.  At the start of the book, Janes reflects on his long-held desire to visit the lands of biblical significance, which ultimately compels him to embark on his journey in July 1904. He details his preparations and initial travels through Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, eventually setting sail for Glasgow. The narrative introduces Janes as a thoughtful, introspective traveler, eager to explore the historical and spiritual significance of the locations he plans to visit, while also engaging in evangelistic work throughout his journey. The opening sets the stage for adventure and discovery, as he captures moments of both profound contemplation and excitement in anticipation of the wonders that await him.
