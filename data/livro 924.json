    "resumo": "\"The Old Maids' Club\" by Israel Zangwill is a comedic novel written in the late 19th century. The book centers around Lillie Dulcimer, a precocious and intelligent young woman who, frustrated by her father's attempts to marry her off, founds a club to redefine the concept of \"Old Maid\" and to attract like-minded, independent women. Through Lillie and the club's humorous by-laws, the story explores the themes of love, societal expectations, and female empowerment.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Lillie Dulcimer, who is characterized by her sharp wit and strong will. After the passing of her mother, Lillie firmly refuses her father's pressure to marry, insisting that she will not settle for any man who does not love her in return. In her frustration, she establishes the Old Maids' Club, designed for young, wealthy, and beautiful women who have spurned marriage offers. The narrative unfolds with Lillie's charming eccentricity as she devises rules to promote an anti-marriage ideology while simultaneously attracting potential members, including the club's first guest, Lord Silverdale, who becomes entangled with the club's mission. This opening portion sets the stage for a humorous exploration of relationships, societal norms, and the quest for self-identity among women. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
