    "resumo": "\"Skinner's Dress Suit\" by Henry Irving Dodge is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the central character, Skinner, a cashier at McLaughlin & Perkins, who is trapped in his mundane job and longs for a raise to accommodate his wife's aspirations. The narrative explores themes of self-esteem, ambition, and the transformative power of outward appearances, particularly highlighted by Skinner's apprehensions and dreams associated with his desire for a dress suit.  The opening of the book introduces Skinner, affectionately dubbed the \"cage man\" by messenger boys, who is gripped by anxiety over asking his boss for a raise. Skinner's fears stem not from physical intimidation, but from his internal struggle and fear of failure, as he has always strived to be a hero in the eyes of his supportive wife, Honey. The narrative captures his reluctance and reflections on their modest savings, the sacrifices Honey has made, and the pressure he feels to prove himself. Ultimately, the stage is set for Skinner's journey as he steps out of his comfort zone, seeking validation and transformation through the lens of social status and material success, embodied by the coveted dress suit.
