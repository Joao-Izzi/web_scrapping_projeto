    "resumo": "\"The Englishman from Paris\" by Arthur Murphy is a comedic play written during the mid-18th century, specifically in 1756. This work falls under the genre of theatrical comedy and is characterized by its satirical take on cultural differences, particularly the clash between English and French manners. The narrative centers on the story of Jack Broughton, an Englishman returning from Paris, illustrating themes of identity and social expectations amidst the backdrop of rising nationalistic sentiments.  The plot follows Jack Broughton, who finds himself at odds with his English peers after adopting French manners during his time abroad. His return is marked by ridicule from friends and family, particularly from Mr. Quicksett, who disapproves of Jack's newfound flamboyant persona. The story unfolds as Jack grapples with societal expectations, while his French tutor, the Abb√©, provides a humorous commentary on English customs. Ultimately, after a series of comedic misadventures and misunderstandings, Jack realizes the importance of embracing his English identity, leading to a resolution that emphasizes the value of authenticity over affectation. The play serves as both entertainment and a critique of national stereotypes, offering audiences a humorous reflection on the complexities of cultural assimilation.
