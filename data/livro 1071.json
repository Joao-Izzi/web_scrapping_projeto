    "resumo": "\"A House to Let\" by Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Adelaide Ann Procter is a collaborative collection of stories written during the mid-19th century. This multifaceted work revolves around the mysterious titular house that has remained unlet for an inexplicably long time and delves into the lives and intertwined narratives of its neighbors, exploring themes of societal change and personal connection.  The opening of the book introduces an elderly female protagonist who has settled in London after living in Tunbridge Wells for a decade. During a visit to her new residence, she learns of the dilapidated house across the street that has been reportedly for rent for years, piquing her curiosity. As she observes the abandoned property, she is struck by a mysterious \"eye\" that seems to watch her, which leads her into a whirlpool of thoughts and burgeoning obsession with the empty abode. Simultaneously humorous and poignant, the dynamics between her loyal servant Trottle and her whimsical medical doctor add richness to her character, intertwining their lives as they attempt to navigate the enigma of the House to Let. This sets the stage for an exploration of personal histories and the secrets that define them. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
