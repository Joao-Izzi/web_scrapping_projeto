    "resumo": "\"Children of the Tenements\" by Jacob A. Riis is a collection of stories that sheds light on the lives of impoverished children in the tenement districts of New York, written in the late 19th century. The narrative highlights the struggles, hopes, and resilience of these children and their families amidst the harsh realities of urban poverty. Through a series of poignant vignettes, Riis aims to portray the pressing social issues of his time, emphasizing the humanity and dignity of those living in the margins of society.  The opening portion of the text introduces us to Adam Grunschlag, a Jewish pedler facing overwhelming difficulties as he navigates life in a cramped and unhealthy basement with his wife and young son, Abe. As his wife becomes gravely ill, he wrestles with the harsh realities of poverty, ultimately deciding to take desperate measures for the well-being of his family, including trying to return an infant, referred to as the “rent baby,” to its rightful parents. This part of the narrative establishes a deep sense of empathy and urgency, foreshadowing the struggles and sacrifices made by these characters in their quest for a better life. The emotional challenges they face are emblematic of the broader plight of many families in similar circumstances, setting the tone for the stories that follow.
