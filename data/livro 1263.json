    "resumo": "\"The Martian Shore\" by Charles L. Fontenay is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The book follows the story of Robbo Shaan, a man branded a traitor by the Imperial Government of Mars for advocating democracy after the Martians' recent loss of freedom. Stranded in the harsh Martian desert, Shaan's journey of survival becomes a testament to his resilience and struggle against tyranny.  The narrative unfolds as Shaan makes a desperate crawl across the barren landscape of Mars, navigating his way toward a dome he believes could offer sanctuary. Facing the brutal realities of dwindling oxygen and a hostile government, he is forced into a cat-and-mouse game for survival. After finding temporary refuge in a canal cactus, Shaan encounters the daughters of a previous settler, leading to a tense confrontation with their father. Eventually, Shaan must choose between self-preservation and the fate of the girls, ultimately leading him to a profound decision about human life and existence on Mars. The story encapsulates themes of democracy, survival, and the innate human desire for freedom against the backdrop of a stark and unforgiving world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
