    "resumo": "\"Mrs. Bindle: Some Incidents from the Domestic Life of the Bindles\" by Herbert Jenkins is a humorous novel written in the early 20th century. The book revolves around Mrs. Bindle, a sharp and determined woman who navigates the challenges of her domestic life in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. The narrative offers a comedic exploration of her struggles with her husband, the eccentricities of their neighbors, and the domestic challenges she faces.  At the start of the book, we witness a lively and contentious exchange between Mrs. Bindle and her husband, Bindle, over his participation in a strike at his workplace. Mrs. Bindle, a no-nonsense woman, expresses her anger over the potential impact of the strike on their family's finances. As Bindle leaves for the pub, Mrs. Bindle locks him out, declaring she has \"struck\" too, which sets off a humorous series of events involving the other dissatisfied wives in their neighborhood. The opening chapter sets the tone for the book, showcasing Mrs. Bindle's combative spirit and the comic dynamics of her domestic environment. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
