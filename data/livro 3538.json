    "resumo": "\"Milton\" by Sir Walter Alexander Raleigh is a literary critique written in the early 20th century. The work presents a comprehensive examination of the life, poetry, and prose of John Milton, focusing particularly on his epic, \"Paradise Lost.\" The author aims to unravel the complexities of Milton’s character, his artistic choices, and the political implications of his work, emphasizing the intensity and singularity of Milton's Puritanism and the impact it had on his writings.  The opening of \"Milton\" sets the stage for a deep exploration of the poet's life, academic pursuits, and influences. It covers Milton's early education and formative years, including the significant cultural and political backdrop of 17th-century England that shaped his worldview. Raleigh delves into the notable absence of humor in Milton’s character, discussing how this might account for the divide between the poet's greatness and popular appreciation. The introduction highlights the difficulty critics face in appreciating Milton's distinct voice, laying the groundwork for further analysis of his writings.
