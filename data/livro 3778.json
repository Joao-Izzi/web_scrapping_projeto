    "resumo": "\"I.N.R.I.: A Prisoner's Story of the Cross\" by Peter Rosegger is a fictional narrative likely written in the early 20th century. The plot centers around Konrad Ferleitner, a prisoner awaiting execution for a crime he did not commit, exploring themes of despair, hope, and salvation. Through his interactions with the gaoler and a monk, as well as his reflections on his past, the story offers profound insight into the human spirit's resilience in the face of tragic circumstances.  The opening of the story introduces us to the chaotic scene outside the law courts as the crowds await the verdict for Konrad Ferleitner, who has been sentenced to death. We learn about his fragile state as he is taken to prison, who longs for the company of a priest not necessarily for confession but for human connection. Isolated in his cell, he reflects on the kindness of his deceased mother and the privileges of his childhood, grappling with the weight of his impending death. His despair leads him to yearn for darkness, yet we see a flicker of hope as he decides to write his thoughts down, indicating a profound journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening that unfolds as he engages with memories and dreams of his past.
