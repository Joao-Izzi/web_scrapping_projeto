    "resumo": "\"Tourists to Terra\" by Mack Reynolds is a science fiction novel likely written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around a group of wealthy thrill-seekers from a distant future who journey to Earth to indulge in the excitement of participating in historical battles. Set against the backdrop of ancient conflicts, it explores themes of adventure and the ethical implications of playing with the past.  The narrative follows the crew of a luxury spaceship that caters to affluent tourists seeking adrenaline-pumping experiences. As they engage in simulated battles, the touristsâ€™ reckless behavior leads to dangerous encounters, particularly with a historical figure, Diomed from Greek mythology. Tensions rise when the passengers express a desire for genuine excitement, pushing the boundaries of safety. After a series of mishaps, including one passenger getting wounded, the crew decides to travel even further into Earth's future, only to confront the potential devastation of atomic warfare. The story ultimately critiques the notion of thrill-seeking without considering the consequences, culminating in a suspenseful climax as the spaceship approaches an era of nuclear weapons.
