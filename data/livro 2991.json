    "resumo": "\"The Gospels in the Second Century\" by W. Sanday is a scholarly examination of early Christian literature written in the late 19th century. The work focuses on the critical analysis of another book titled \"Supernatural Religion\" and aims to explore the historical context and evidence surrounding the formation of the New Testament Gospels during the second century.   At the start of this examination, Sanday sets a reflective tone, indicating his intention to navigate away from a straightforward critique of \"Supernatural Religion\" due to its controversial nature and instead aims for a rigorous critique of the arguments presented. He discusses the difficulties associated with establishing the authority and existence of the Gospels, emphasizing the importance of historical accuracy and the inherent biases present in scholarly work. Sanday notes that many early Christian writers quoted from memory or adapted texts rather freely, raising challenges in discerning original meanings and contexts. This opening portion establishes the foundational questions regarding revelation and interpretation that Sanday will continue to explore throughout his investigation.
