    "resumo": "\"The Governess\" by Julie M. Lippmann is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the life of a young girl named Nan Cutler and her challenging encounters with her new governess, Miss Blake, who comes to impose structure and discipline on her untamed spirit. The narrative explores themes of childhood, independence, and the struggle between authority and freedom.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Nan, a lively and rebellious fourteen-year-old girl who grapples with the fallout from an accident involving a younger child, Ruth. As Nan faces the disapproval of Ruth's mother and the prospect of a new governess coming to stay in her home, we witness her strong-willed nature and resistance to being controlled. In this opening portion, Nan's emotional landscape is vividly portrayed as she navigates her relationships with those around her, including her loyal but conflicted caretaker, Delia. This sets the stage for the ensuing conflict and growth that promises to unfold as the governess makes her entrance into Nanâ€™s chaotic life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
