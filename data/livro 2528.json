    "resumo": "\"Practical Education, Volume I\" by Maria Edgeworth and Richard Lovell Edgeworth is a treatise on educational philosophy and practical teaching methods written in the early 19th century. The work advocates for an approach to education that prioritizes experiential learning and the emotional well-being of children, opposing more rigid traditional methods. The central focus is on how to educate young children effectively, highlighting the importance of toys and tasks in fostering natural curiosity and a love for learning.  The opening of the work presents an important discussion on the appropriateness of children's toys and their educational value. It begins with a mother's inquiry into why her child is not playing with his toys, leading to a reflection on how children often dismantle toys not out of mischief, but from a desire to explore and understand. The authors critique common toys for lacking utility and fail to engage childrenâ€™s imaginations, suggesting that toys should promote exploration and creativity. They assert that the nursery must be a space tailored for active inquiry, discussing how the first steps in education begin with allowing children to engage with their surroundings in meaningful ways.
