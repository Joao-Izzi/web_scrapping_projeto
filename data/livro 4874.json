    "resumo": "\"The Hero of the Filipinos: The Story of José Rizal, Poet, Patriot and Martyr\" by Charles Edward Russell and E. B. Rodriguez is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work centers on José Rizal, a significant figure in Philippine history known for his poetry, patriotism, and tragic martyrdom. The authors aim to shed light on his life and the broader context of the struggles of the Filipino people against colonial oppression, particularly during the Spanish rule.  The opening of the book sets the stage by detailing the oppressive conditions of the Philippines under Spanish tyranny, vividly illustrating the injustices faced by ordinary Filipinos. It introduces readers to Francisco Rizal Mercado, José Rizal's father, and describes his unfortunate encounters with the corrupt Spanish authorities. As the narrative unfolds, it highlights the prevailing climate of brutality, prejudice, and systematic injustice that formed Rizal’s formative experiences as a youth, ultimately portraying how these heavy burdens laid the groundwork for his awakening to a sense of national identity and the fight for reform. Thus, the beginning provides crucial context for understanding Rizal’s character, motivations, and the historic turbulence that pervaded his life and work.
