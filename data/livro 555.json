    "resumo": "\"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court\" by Edward S. Corwin is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work explores the life and impact of John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the United States, and examines his role in establishing the authority of the Supreme Court and the principles embodied in the Constitution.   The opening of the book sets the context for Marshall's significance within the framework of American governance, likening the judicial system to an ecclesiastical hierarchy, with Marshall as its pivotal figure, akin to a great Pope. It lays the groundwork for understanding the early struggles of the U.S. judiciary, detailing the foundational decisions made during the Constitutional Convention and the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation. This chapter also hints at the conflicts between state and federal powers, which became prominent during Marshall's tenure, foreshadowing the battles he would have to navigate in asserting the supremacy of federal law and the judicial review that would cement the Court's central role in American democracy.
