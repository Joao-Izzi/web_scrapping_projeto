    "resumo": "\"Cetywayo and his White Neighbours\" by H. Rider Haggard is a historical account first published in the late 19th century. The narrative explores the complex relationships and tensions between the Zulu king Cetywayo, the British government, and the Boer settlers in South Africa, particularly focusing on the precarious state of affairs following the annexation of the Transvaal. The work aims to provide insights into the political dynamics of the time and the impact of colonial policies on indigenous peoples in the region.  The opening of the book establishes a context for the author's exploration of Zulu affairs, articulating a sense of urgency regarding the stability of Zululand and the implications of Cetywayo's potential visit to England. Haggard sets the stage by discussing the historical backdrop of Zulu leadership, including past monarchs like Chaka and Dingaan. The text highlights Cetywayo's coronation amid political strife and his intricate dealings with both his own people and the colonial powers at play. Notably, it reflects on the lingering challenges in managing Zulu governance, the risks of renewed conflict, and the influence of pressing political conditions both locally and abroad, indicating a tumultuous future for both the Zulus and their white neighbors.
