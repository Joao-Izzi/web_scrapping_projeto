    "resumo": "\"The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation\" by Richard Hakluyt is a historical account compiled in the late 16th century that chronicles the maritime explorations and trade endeavors of the English. This extensive work serves as a record of various voyages, detailing encounters and exchanges between English sailors, traders, and foreign lands, particularly focusing on regions such as Africa and the Mediterranean.  The opening of this volume sets the stage for the exploration of English adventures in Africa, recounting the story of Henry, Earl of Derby (later King Henry IV) and his military expedition to Tunis with a coalition of English and French forces against the Moors. It details the joint efforts of these nations, including their struggles and victories, and highlights the bravery of the English archers that facilitated their landing. Hakluyt employs historical texts and chronicles, such as those by Polydore Virgile, to lend credibility to the narrative, mapping the complex interplay of military, diplomatic, and trade relations during this era of exploration and conquest.
