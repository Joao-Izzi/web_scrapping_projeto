    "resumo": "\"Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern — Volume 16\" edited by Charles Dudley Warner and others is a collection of classic literary works, likely compiled in the late 19th century. This anthology encompasses various genres, including historical texts, moral tales, and philosophical writings, aimed at providing readers with an in-depth look into significant literary contributions from both ancient and modern times. The volume features excerpts and discussions from notable authors such as Gibbon, Gogol, and Goethe, among others, offering a blend of narratives, ethical commentaries, and cultural reflections.  At the start of the work, the reader is introduced to the foundational text of Aulus Gellius’s 'Attic Nights', which outlines his intentions to create a diverse collection of writings that range from philosophical musings to the intricacies of Roman customs and history. Gellius emphasizes the irregular yet enlightening nature of his compilation, sharing anecdotes about topics such as the Vestal Virgins and the mysteries of the Senate, alongside philosophical discussions on the nature of sight. The opening also highlights the inclusion of various other pieces, such as moral stories from the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and historical essays by Edward Gibbon, setting a precedent for the multifaceted exploration of literature and moral thought that defines this anthology.
