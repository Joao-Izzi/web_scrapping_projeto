    "resumo": "\"The Pillar of Fire; or, Israel in Bondage\" by J. H. Ingraham is a historical novel written in the mid-19th century. The story is set during the time of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, intertwining fictional characters with biblical events. The protagonist is Prince Sesostris of Phoenicia, who travels to Egypt to study its laws, arts, and customs, and becomes a witness to the oppression of the Hebrew people.  The opening of the work introduces Prince Sesostris as he arrives in Egypt, expressing awe at the grandeur of the land and its people. Through letters to his mother, he describes the magnificence of the city of On, the powerful court of Queen Amense, and the oppression faced by the Israelites, whom he observes as they labor under cruel taskmasters. As he prepares to engage with Egyptian culture, the tone reflects a blend of admiration for Egypt's splendor and sympathy for the suffering of the Israelites. The letters not only set the stage for the unfolding drama but also highlight the contrast between the lavishness of Egyptian life and the dire plight of the Hebrews, foreshadowing the spiritual and moral conflict that will develop as the narrative progresses.
