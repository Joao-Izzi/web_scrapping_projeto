    "resumo": "\"The New Joan, and Other Poems\" by Katherine Hale is a collection of poetry written in the early 20th century, specifically during the time of World War I. The poems explore themes of women's work, sacrifice, and spiritual renewal, highlighting the intertwining roles of love, war, and creation. The title piece, \"The New Joan,\" alludes to the figure of Joan of Arc, symbolizing courage and the call to serve one's country.  The collection comprises several poems, each delving into various aspects of life and humanity during tumultuous times. \"The New Joan\" serves as a central theme, representing both a return to the valor of Joan of Arc and the emergence of a new spirit in the face of war. Other poems, such as \"Christmas Song,\" reflect on the harsh realities of soldiers in the trenches, while \"The Mother\" expresses a mother's anguish over her son at war. Through her vivid imagery and emotional depth, Hale creates a tapestry that connects individual experiences of love, loss, and hope, ultimately urging readers to find beauty and strength in both the trials of life and the promise of new beginnings.
