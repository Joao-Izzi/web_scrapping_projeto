    "resumo": "\"A Father of Women, and Other Poems\" by Alice Meynell is a collection of poetry written in the early 20th century. The book explores themes of loss, love, femininity, and the impacts of war, particularly reflecting on the emotional landscape of a world shaped by conflict. Meynell's work often intertwines personal introspection with broader observations on the human experience, particularly in the context of her time, which was marked by the struggle and sacrifice of World War I.  The collection comprises various poems that convey deep feelings of mourning and remembrance, especially for those lost in battle. The titular poem \"A Father of Women\" addresses the enduring influence of fathers on their children, while other works, such as \"Nurse Edith Cavell\" and \"Summer in England, 1914,\" reflect on the juxtaposition of beauty in nature against the backdrop of human suffering. Throughout the poems, Meynell employs rich imagery and emotive language to evoke a sense of both the fragility and resilience of life, ultimately encouraging readers to contemplate the profound connections between love, loss, and the passage of time.
