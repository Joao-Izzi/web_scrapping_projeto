    "resumo": "\"The Real Cyberpunk Fakebook\" by St. Jude, R.U. Sirius, and Bart Nagel is a satirical guidebook written in the mid-1990s, a time of burgeoning interest in digital culture and technology. This book explores the concept of cyberpunk, a subgenre of science fiction that blends advanced technology with societal collapse, and serves as both a humorous manifesto and a lifestyle guide for aspiring cyberpunks and tech enthusiasts. Its unique approach to cyber culture and identity entertains while also critiquing the superficiality often associated with being \"hip.\"  The book is structured in a manner reminiscent of an ironic how-to manual, filled with tongue-in-cheek advice on embodying the cyberpunk lifestyle. It includes chapters on achieving a cyberpunk appearance—essentially a uniform of black leather and mirrorshades—as well as insights into specific subcultures within the cyberpunk community, such as goths, hackers, and technopagans. The authors provide a lexicon of playful jargon and colloquialisms associated with the cyber world, elaborate on the must-know films and literature, and even present a humorous take on the art of hacking. Overall, \"The Real Cyberpunk Fakebook\" presents a vibrant snapshot of a countercultural movement, blending humor and commentary in a way that both informs and entertains its readers.
