    "resumo": "\"Le retour d'Imray\" by Rudyard Kipling is a short story written in the early 20th century. It revolves around the mysterious disappearance of a man named Imray from his position in a small Indian station, capturing the intrigue and curiosity of his contemporaries.

The opening portion introduces us to Imray, a seemingly vibrant individual who suddenly vanishes without a trace, leaving behind a baffled community and prompting investigation. His absence eventually becomes an anecdote, overshadowed by the everyday workings of the British Empire. Meanwhile, the story shifts focus to Strickland, a police officer who moves into Imray's empty bungalow and finds himself amid an eerie ambiance, as his dog Tietjens reacts to unseen presences. The tension escalates as events unfold, leading to a grim discovery that suggests darker undercurrents in Imray's fate. This sets the tone for a tale filled with suspense and the exploration of human emotions against the backdrop of imperial life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
