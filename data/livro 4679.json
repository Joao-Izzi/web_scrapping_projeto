    "resumo": "\"The Pronunciation of English Words Derived from the Latin\" by John Sargeaunt is a scholarly publication written in the early 20th century. This text examines the principles and historical context behind the pronunciation of English words that have been borrowed from Latin, providing detailed rules that characterize the English adaptation of Latin phonetics.   The opening of this work introduces the premise that English pronunciation of Latin-derived words is governed by a specific set of rules that have evolved over centuries. Sargeaunt meticulously outlines how Latin was taught and pronounced in England from its introduction by missionaries in the 7th century through to the Middle Ages, emphasizing changes influenced by rhyme, rhythm, and the evolution of the English language itself. He explores various intricacies of vowel sounds, stress patterns, and phonetic changes, setting the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between Latin pronunciation and its impact on Modern English linguistics.
