    "resumo": "\"The Merchant of Venice\" by William Shakespeare is a play written in the late 16th century. The narrative explores themes of love, revenge, and mercy through the lives of various characters in Venice, notably focusing on Antonio, a merchant, and his bond with Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. As the story unfolds, conflicts arise from a mix of financial dealings and personal relationships, with love interests such as Bassanio and Portia taking center stage.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to Antonio, who is inexplicably sad, a mood that is a subject of discussion among his friends Salarino and Salanio. They speculate that his melancholy stems from his precarious ventures at sea. Soon after, Bassanio arrives and discloses his intent to woo the wealthy heiress Portia by borrowing money from Antonio, even though Antonioâ€™s funds are tied up in ship ventures. Meanwhile, Shylock, who holds a grudge against Antonio for lending without interest, agrees to lend the required sum on the condition that if Antonio defaults, Shylock will take a pound of his flesh. This sets the stage for the central tension of the play: the implications of love, loyalty, and the harshness of legal obligation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
