    "resumo": "\"The Regulating Silver Coin, Made Practicable and Easie, to the Government and Subject\" by a Lover of his Country is a historical economic treatise written in the late 17th century. The book addresses the issues of currency debasement, scarcity of silver coin in England, and methods for reforming the monetary system. It presents a detailed analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic values of money, focusing on the historical context of England's financial troubles during a time of war.  In this work, the author argues that the quality of silver coin has deteriorated, leading to significant economic issues including hoarding and exportation of good currency. The text lays out several chapters discussing the badness of current coin, scarcity, strategies for the importation of silver, and potential reforms to stabilize the monetary system. The proposed solutions include calling in clipt and diminished money, compensating owners fairly, re-issuing new coin with adequate intrinsic value, and ensuring a robust and reliable currency that reflects real economic conditions. The work aims to provide practical solutions to improve the economy, support trade, and restore confidence in England's currency during uncertain times.
