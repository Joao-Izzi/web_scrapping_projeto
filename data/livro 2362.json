    "resumo": "\"For the Honor of the School: A Story of School Life and Interscholastic Sport\" by Ralph Henry Barbour is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the experiences of students at Hillton Academy, particularly focusing on athletics and the competitive spirit surrounding interscholastic sports. The main characters include Donald Cunningham, the captain of the cross-country team, and the novice Wayne Gordon, who learns lessons about teamwork, determination, and personal growth throughout the narrative.  The opening of the book introduces the excitement and tension of a cross-country race, along with the meticulous preparations of the Hillton Academy team. Through the interactions between the boys, we see Donald offering encouragement and strategies to his friend Wayne, who is uncertain about his abilities. The atmosphere is charged with competitiveness as they face their rivals from St. Eustace and Shrewsburg High Schools. Wayne's initial reluctance to compete due to a lack of experience contrasts with Donald's confidence, setting the stage for themes of friendship, rivalry, and personal development that unfold as the story progresses. The introduction establishes both the physical challenges of the race and the emotional weight behind the desire to win for the honor of their school. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
