    "resumo": "\"New Lamps\" by Robert Moore Williams is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century. Set on Mars, the story revolves around the exploration of deep existential and ethical questions through the lens of a scientifically advanced society that struggles with its own moral shortcomings. The narrative follows Jim Ronson, a bio-physicist from Earth, on a quest to seek out the enigmatic Martian figure known as Les Ro, who is rumored to possess revolutionary knowledge that could hold the key to profound human troubles, particularly cancer.  In the book, Ronson arrives on Mars with aspirations of uncovering solutions to humanity's pressing medical issues. His journey becomes tumultuous as he navigates the harsh realities of Martian life, the indifference of the local populace toward humans, and unexpected alliancesâ€”most notably with Jennie Ware, a daring author eager to unveil the secrets of Les Ro. As Ronson and Jennie face various challenges, including confrontations with Martian criminals and existential threats, their quest ultimately leads them to a confrontation with Les Ro, who harbors extraordinary powers of healing and transformation. The story culminates in a quest for personal and societal redemption, where the characters are challenged to confront their innermost fears and desires, ultimately seeking to forge a new path for both humanity and Martians through shared knowledge and understanding.
