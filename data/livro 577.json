    "resumo": "\"The Perjur'd Husband; or, The Adventures of Venice. A Tragedy\" by Susanna Centlivre is a theatrical play likely written in the early 18th century. This work captures the tumultuous emotional dynamics and entangled relationships among its characters, set against the vibrant backdrop of Venetian carnival festivities. The narrative centers around Count Bassino, who is caught in a web of love, duty, and betrayal between his wife, Placentia, and his love interest, Aurelia, leading to dramatic confrontations and misunderstandings.  The opening of the play introduces us to the lively atmosphere of a masked ball in Venice, where characters engage in flirtation and intrigue. Count Bassino wrestles with his conflicting feelings; he feels obliged to his wife while deeply enamored with Aurelia. Meanwhile, Aurelia is torn between her affections for Bassino and her betrothal to Alonzo, another character who is also in pursuit of her love. The stage is set for a blend of romantic entanglements and impending chaos, as charactersâ€™ passions lead them toward a potentially tragic outcome, wrapped in the thematic examination of fidelity and honor.
