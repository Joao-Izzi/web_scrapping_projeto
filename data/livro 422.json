    "resumo": "\"Essays of Michel de Montaigne — Volume 17\" by Michel de Montaigne is a philosophical essay written during the late 16th century. This volume is part of a larger collection that explores personal reflections on a varied range of topics, such as human nature, society, and life itself. The essays intertwine personal anecdotes and observations, inviting readers to ponder deeper truths about vanity and existence in light of Montaigne's musings.  The opening of this essay focuses on the theme of vanity, where Montaigne critiques the act of writing about vanity itself, acknowledging the inherent contradiction in such an endeavor. He reflects on the superficiality of societal concerns and the overwhelming nature of trivialities that plague human existence. Using anecdotes and historical references, Montaigne critiques the actions of those who engage in pointless discussions and idle pursuits, suggesting that true wisdom lies in self-knowledge and a reflective mindset. Throughout the beginning, Montaigne’s candidness about his own imperfections and preferences reveals his earnest desire for understanding amidst life's chaos, setting the tone for his philosophical explorations in the subsequent sections.
