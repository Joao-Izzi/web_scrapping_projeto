    "resumo": "\"Fort Duquesne and Fort Pitt; Early Names of Pittsburgh Streets\" is a historical account published by the Fort Pitt Society Daughters of the American Revolution in the early 20th century. This work explores the significant military and colonial history surrounding the early forts in Pittsburgh, particularly focusing on Fort Duquesne and Fort Pitt. As a historical document, it examines the conflicts involving the French and British empires in North America, while also touching on the early names of streets in Pittsburgh that pay homage to various figures and events from this period.  The book details the establishment and strategic importance of Fort Duquesne, built by the French in response to British territorial claims, and the subsequent capture and construction of Fort Pitt by British forces. It recounts the military campaigns, including the infamous Braddock's defeat and the eventual success of General Forbesâ€™ expedition, which culminated in the British control of the area. Additionally, the narrative provides insights into the relationships between various Indigenous tribes and both colonial powers, reflecting on how these historical elements influenced the naming of Pittsburgh's streets. The work serves not only as a retelling of battles and military strategy but also as a tribute to those who shaped the region's early history, highlighting their legacies in the very fabric of the modern city.
