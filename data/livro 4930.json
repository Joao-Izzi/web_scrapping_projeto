    "resumo": "\"A Sub and a Submarine: The Story of H.M. Submarine R19 in the Great War\" by Percy F. Westerman is a historical account written during the early 20th century. The book explores the adventures and duties of Sub-Lieutenant Noel Fordyce aboard the submarine R19 during World War I. It dives into themes of loyalty, danger, and moral dilemmas as Fordyce navigates both external threats and personal challenges involving his beloved dog, Flirt.  The opening of the story introduces us to Sub-Lieutenant Fordyce and his pet Irish terrier, Flirt, as he attempts to protect her from the aggressive actions of Councillor Mindiggle, who blackmails him into smuggling diamonds to Russia. The tension builds as Fordyce struggles with the moral implications of Mindiggleâ€™s demands, considering the safety of both his dog and his duty as a naval officer. This sets the stage for a compelling narrative filled with espionage, warfare, and the personal stakes involved in serving during a time of great conflict.
