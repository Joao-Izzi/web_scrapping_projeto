    "resumo": "\"The Trade Union Woman\" by Alice Henry is a historical account written in the early 20th century that explores the evolution of trade unionism through the lens of working women in the United States and Canada. The book aims to highlight the unique challenges faced by wage-earning women, particularly in terms of working conditions, wages, and their rights within the labor movement. Henry, a member of the Office Employ√©s' Association of Chicago and a former editor of \"Life and Labor\", seeks to provide a comprehensive depiction of women's roles in trade unions and the socio-economic context that shapes their experiences.  The opening of the book establishes a strong preface that frames the discussion around the necessity of organizing women in the labor force. It discusses the exploitative working conditions that women endure and argues for the importance of collective action to improve these situations. Henry introduces the idea that improving the conditions of working women not only benefits them individually but also elevates the labor movement as a whole. In this portion, she emphasizes the urgency of raising awareness about women's struggles in the workforce and positions her work as a crucial guide for those interested in the labor movement and women's rights. Ultimately, this sets the groundwork for further exploration of women's involvement in trade unions throughout the rest of the book. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
