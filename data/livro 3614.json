    "resumo": "\"Bridge Crossing\" by Dave Dryfoos is a science fiction narrative written during the early 21st century. The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic setting marked by the remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Themes of identity, belonging, and the nature of humanity are prevalent as the protagonist navigates a world dominated by android soldiers and a faction of humans referred to as \"Invaders\". The book primarily explores the internal conflict of its central character, Roddie, who grapples with his unique existence and a desire to prove his worth among beings that appear mechanized and superior.  The plot centers around Roddie, who has grown up in a city largely protected by android soldiers after a catastrophe devastated the world. As Roddie interacts with Molly, his caretaker, and the other soldiers, he feels increasingly alienated due to his humanity. The arrival of an Invader girl, Ida, shifts the dynamic, presenting Roddie with a conflict about loyalty and understanding. As they journey together towards the ruined Golden Gate Bridge, Roddie grapples with his perception of the world and begins to question what constitutes superiority and purpose. Throughout their encounters, Roddie discovers the emotional depth of humanity, culminating in a transformative realization that leads him to acknowledge his identity as a human being rather than a mere construct of a bygone era.
