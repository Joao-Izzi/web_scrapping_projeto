    "resumo": "\"The Christmas Makers' Club\" by Edith A. Sawyer is a children’s novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around three girls—Elsa, Betty, and Alice—who decide to form a club dedicated to creating Christmas gifts, including toys for children at a nearby convalescent home. The book explores themes of friendship, creativity, and compassion as the young girls navigate their different family backgrounds and challenges.  At the start of the narrative, the girls express their desire for a new activity to break the monotony of school. Their conversation leads to the idea of starting a Christmas club, where they can work together on crafts and share fellowship. As they convene at Betty's home, their dynamics unfold—each girl bringing her own personality and challenges to the group. The introduction of Miss Ruth, a caring adult figure, adds a nurturing element, as she supports their project and becomes involved in their creative endeavors. The opening sets a warm, whimsical tone that suggests a heartfelt journey of friendship and creativity ahead. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
