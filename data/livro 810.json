    "resumo": "\"Campaign of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry\" by James Cooper is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book chronicles the experiences of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Spanish-American War, detailing their journey from initial mobilization to active service in Puerto Rico. It focuses on the daily lives, challenges, and adventures of the troop members as they face the realities of military life and combat.  At the start of the narrative, the author introduces the context of the impending war, linking the mobilization of the Troop to the events following the destruction of the U.S. Battleship Maine. The men muster for their annual inspection amidst rising tensions between the U.S. and Spain, eventually preparing to leave for Camp Mt. Gretna. The opening chapters vividly portray the Troopers' training, camaraderie, and the abrupt transition from civilian life to the uncertainties of military duty. Through personal observations, letters, and anecdotes from the Troopers, the beginning sets the stage for their historic campaign and the unique experiences that await them.
