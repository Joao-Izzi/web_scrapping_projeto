    "resumo": "\"The Urine Dance of the Zuni Indians of New Mexico\" by John Gregory Bourke is an ethnological study written in the early 20th century. This book explores a unique ritual of the Zuni Indians, specifically focusing on a peculiar dance that involves the consumption of human urine as part of the ceremonial proceedings. Bourke, a Captain in the U.S. Army, provides a firsthand account of this ritual, illustrating its cultural and historical context within the Zuni community.  In the narrative, Bourke describes his experience attending the urine dance, where he witnesses Zuni performers engaging in an elaborate and grotesque presentation that parodies elements of Catholic worship while incorporating humor and vulgarity. Participants consume urine in front of a mixed audience, highlighting the ceremony's shocking nature. It is suggested that this dance served both as a test of endurance and a reflection on historical experiences of deprivation faced by the Zunis during periods of conflict. Bourke attempts to contextualize the ritual, linking it to broader themes of survival and the intertwining of religious and medicinal practices among indigenous peoples. Overall, the book serves as a vivid, albeit unsettling, description of a specific cultural tradition, shedding light on the complexities of Zuni ceremonial life.
