    "resumo": "\"Some of Our East Coast Towns\" by J. Ewing Ritchie is a collection of travel essays written in the late 19th century. The book offers a vivid exploration of various towns along the East Coast of England, including Chelmsford, Colchester, Hadleigh, and others, detailing their histories, local culture, and significant landmarks. Ritchie, writing under the pseudonym Christopher Crayon, blends personal observations with historical anecdotes, painting each location as a character in its own right.  The opening of the book introduces Chelmsford, presenting it as a young borough with modern industry juxtaposed against remnants of historical significance. Ritchie reflects on the town's transformation from a county town to a respectable suburb of London, exploring its local institutions, industry, and civic life. He paints a picture of a community proud of its past yet firmly rooted in modernity, as he discusses public spaces like the museum and its notable electrical manufacturing firm. This combination of history and contemporary life sets the tone for the subsequent entries about other towns, suggesting a rich tapestry of local character across East Anglia.
