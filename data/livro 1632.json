    "resumo": "\"Insula Sanctorum et Doctorum; Or, Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars\" by John Healy is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work explores the rich educational and spiritual heritage of ancient Ireland, particularly focusing on the monastic schools established during the early Christian period following the arrival of St. Patrick. Healy aims to trace Ireland's historical legacy as the \"Island of Saints and Scholars,\" showcasing the significant contributions made by its religious communities to learning and culture.  The opening of this work sets the stage for an examination of the state of learning in Ireland before and during St. Patrick's time. It begins by discussing the Druids, Bards, and Brehons as the primary learned classes in ancient Ireland, providing insights into their roles in society, including their knowledge, practices, and the oral traditions they upheld. The text emphasizes the limited access to education and writing before St. Patrick, arguing against the notion of Ireland being a barbarous land devoid of knowledge, thereby preparing readers to appreciate the deeper exploration of the cultural and educational developments that followed.
