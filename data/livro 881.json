    "resumo": "\"Confessio Amantis; Or, Tales of the Seven Deadly Sins\" by John Gower is a collection of narrative poems written during the late 14th century. This work explores themes of love, human vices, and morality through the lens of allegory and storytelling, prominently featuring the character of Amans, a lover who seeks redemption and guidance for his failed romances through the confessions he offers to the poet's persona, who acts as his confessor.  The opening of \"Confessio Amantis\" sets the stage for a profound exploration of love and its complexities. It begins with a prologue in which the speaker reflects on the nature of writing and the human condition, expressing a desire to address the sins that plague humanity, particularly the seven deadly sins. Early in the narrative, Amans laments his unfulfilled love and desperation, appealing to Venus, the goddess of love, for relief from his torment. Through interactions with divine figures and a focus on personal reflection, Gower delves into themes of desire, guilt, and the need for purification, inviting readers to reflect on their own moral journeys. This introduction sets a rich, contemplative tone for the tales that follow, which promise both wisdom and entertainment. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
