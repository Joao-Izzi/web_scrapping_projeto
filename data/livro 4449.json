    "resumo": "\"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare is a tragedy written in the late 16th century. The play follows Prince Hamlet of Denmark as he navigates themes of revenge, madness, and moral corruption after the death of his father, the king, and the hasty marriage of his mother, Gertrude, to his uncle, Claudius. As Hamlet grapples with his grief and suspicion, the drama unfolds against a backdrop of ghostly apparitions and existential dilemmas.  The opening of \"Hamlet\" sets the stage for the unfolding tragedy, beginning on the cold battlements of Elsinore Castle where sentries Bernardo and Francisco are on guard. They are soon joined by Horatio, a friend of Hamlet, who has been told about a ghostly sighting resembling the late king. The tension escalates as they discuss the implications of this ghostly presence, alluding to political unrest in Denmark due to a threat from the young Fortinbras of Norway. The first act also introduces Hamlet as he mourns the loss of his father, feels a deep sense of betrayal by his mother, and becomes embroiled in the intrigue surrounding the ghost's mysterious appearance, ultimately leading him to seek vengeance for his father's death. The atmosphere is charged with themes of uncertainty and foreboding that will resonate throughout the play. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
