    "resumo": "\"The Psychology of Nations\" by G. E. Partridge is a philosophical examination of the national consciousness and the psychological motivations behind war, written in the early 20th century. Providing insight into the complexities of human behavior, the book analyzes how various factors, including biological, psychological, and social elements, contribute to the history and nature of warfare. With its exploration of motives such as power, fear, and group dynamics, the work seeks to understand how these factors shape the actions and decisions of nations.  The opening of \"The Psychology of Nations\" begins with the author reflecting on the timing of the book's completion during the aftermath of World War I and the ongoing Peace Conference. Partridge sets the stage by addressing the pressing questions surrounding human motives and ideals in the context of historical progress and conflict. He introduces the first part of the text, which deals with the motives of war, explaining that both historical understanding and present motivations must be examined to grasp the essence of human behavior in warfare. Partridge also emphasizes the necessity of critically analyzing the roots of war instead of accepting them passively, hinting at a deeper investigation into how national character and societal evolution play essential roles in shaping the future of international relations.
