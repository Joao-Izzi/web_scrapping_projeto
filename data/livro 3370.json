    "resumo": "\"Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám and Salámán and Absál\" by Omar Khayyám, Edward FitzGerald, and Jami is a collection of classic Persian poetry translated into English verse, likely compiled in the 19th century. This work encompasses the famous quatrains of Khayyám, reflecting on themes of love, existence, and the fleeting nature of life, alongside \"Salámán and Absál,\" a narrative poem exploring love and desire. The translations aim to capture the essence of Persian poetry while adapting it for an English-speaking audience.  The opening of this edition features an illustration and a preface that outlines the significance of the poets involved, particularly Edward FitzGerald as the translator of Khayyám’s work. It also hints at the biography of FitzGerald, discussing his friendships and literary life, while providing context on the historical background of Omar Khayyám, including his achievements in mathematics and astronomy alongside his poetic legacy. The translations themselves commence with verses that vividly depict the beauty of nature, the joys of wine, and the melancholy of life's transience, inviting readers into a contemplative and lyrical exploration of human emotions and experiences.
