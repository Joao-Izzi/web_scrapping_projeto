The story revolves around the titular character, Lucien Leuwen, a young man navigating his way through the complexities of social, political, and romantic life in post-revolutionary France. The novel explores themes of ambition, identity, and the struggles between different social classes.  The opening of \"Lucien Leuwen\" introduces readers to the protagonist, who has recently been expelled from the Ã‰cole polytechnique for his rebellious actions during a period of political upheaval. Following his dismissal, Lucien finds solace in the company of his affluent father, a carefree banker, and his socially graceful mother. As he grapples with his new status and the expectations placed upon him, Lucien's interactions with his relatives further emphasize his struggle to fit into an elite society that values superficial appearances and social maneuvering over genuine character. Throughout the opening, Lucien is depicted as a young man of earnest ideals, caught between the allure of military life and the realities of his emerging identity.
