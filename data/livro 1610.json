    "resumo": "\"Ultimatum de 11 de Janeiro\" by Antero de Quental is a political and social essay written in the late 19th century. The book examines the national movement that transpired on January 11, 1890, focusing on the patriotic fervor of the Portuguese people in the wake of a significant political ultimatum from England. Quental delves into the disconnection between the Portuguese populace and their governing institutions, analyzing the need for reform and unity within the nation.  In the essay, Quental articulates a dual observation about the January 11th movement, identifying a passionate affirmation of Portuguese nationalism while simultaneously critiquing the failures of political institutions. He warns that without a genuine representation of the people's sentiments in government, the movement risks devolving into chaos or anarchy. Quental advocates for a moral and nationalistic rejuvenation of the state, calling for the establishment of organizations that can articulate and impose true national sentiments on any government in power. The work culminates in a call for reform to restore trust between the Portuguese people and their government, emphasizing the necessity of aligning the state with the collective will of the nation to pave the way for societal revival.
