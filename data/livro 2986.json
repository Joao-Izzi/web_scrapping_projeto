    "resumo": "\"More Songs From Vagabondia\" by Bliss Carman and Richard Hovey is a collection of poetic works written during the late 19th century. This anthology captures the essence of wandering souls, exploring themes of nature, love, and the transient beauty of life. The poetry invites readers to embrace the spirit of adventure, the joy of companionship, and the ephemeral moments that make life worth living, essentially encapsulating a celebration of vagabond life.\"  The collection features a diverse array of poems, often characterized by their lyrical quality and rich imagery. Many of the pieces explore the connections between humanity and the natural world, with metaphors drawn from flora and fauna. Poems like \"A Vagabond Song\" stir feelings of nostalgia and yearning, while \"KARLENE\" reflects on a child's potential and the joys of existence. The authors employ a sense of rhythm and musicality throughout the verses, harnessing a spirit of freedom and spontaneity. The collection serves not only as an homage to the wandering spirit but also as a reminder to cherish every fleeting moment of beauty in the world. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
