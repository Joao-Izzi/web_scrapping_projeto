    "resumo": "\"A Greek-English Lexicon to the New Testament\" by William Greenfield is a reference work designed for biblical scholars and students written in the late 19th century. This lexicon serves as a guide to the Greek language used in the New Testament, providing definitions and contextual information for a significant number of Greek words. The lexicon aims to enrich the understanding of biblical texts by clarifying the nuances of the original language.  The opening portion of the lexicon presents a detailed preface that discusses the significance of language in conveying divine revelation, emphasizing the importance of both Hebrew and Greek in the Scriptures. The author elaborates on the historical evolution of these languages, arguing for the necessity of studying the original words of the New Testament to fully grasp the intended meanings. As it lays the groundwork for understanding the lexicon's structure and purpose, the preface highlights how the lexicon is targeted toward both lay readers and scholars, making the study of the New Testament accessible to a broader audience.
