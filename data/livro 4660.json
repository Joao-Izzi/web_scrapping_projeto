    "resumo": "\"Humility: The Beauty of Holiness\" by Andrew Murray is a spiritual treatise written in the late 19th century. The work explores the profound significance of humility as a central virtue in the Christian faith. Murray delves into the idea that true holiness is inextricably linked to a deep sense of humility, emphasizing that, through the humility of Christ, believers can attain a closer relationship with God and a more profound experience of His grace.  At the start of the book, Murray lays the foundation for his exploration of humility by discussing its essential role in the believer's relationship with God. He argues that humility is not simply a response to sin but rather the natural state in which creatures should exist in relation to the Creator. The text presents humility as both a virtue and a source of grace, illustrated by Christ's own humility during His life on Earth. Murray aims to guide readers towards a deeper understanding of how embracing humility can lead to personal transformation and greater holiness in both their spiritual and daily lives.
