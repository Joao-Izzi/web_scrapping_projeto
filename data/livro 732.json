    "resumo": "\"Fabiola eli katakombien kirkko\" by Nicholas Patrick Wiseman is a historical fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative is set in ancient Rome during the early 4th century AD, focusing on the lives of its characters as they navigate the complexities of faith and society amidst the backdrop of impending Christian persecution. In the story, the central figures include Lucina, a noble Christian widow, and her son Pankratius, whose faith is challenged as he encounters both the beauty and dangers of their world.  The opening of the book introduces us to the historical context of Rome while portraying a poignant scene between Lucina and her son, Pankratius. As they converse, Pankratius shares his experiences from school, where he faced hostility from peers for expressing his Christian beliefs. The narrative highlights his inner conflict about standing up for his faith in a time of turmoil. Meanwhile, Lucina's worries for her son are palpable, as she hopes that he may become a martyr for their belief system, reminiscent of his deceased father. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of themes such as faith, sacrifice, and the struggle between paganism and early Christianity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
