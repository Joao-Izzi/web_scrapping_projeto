    "resumo": "\"Loinen: Kertomus\" by K. A. Järvi is a novel written in the early 20th century.\" The story is set against the backdrop of a harsh winter in Finland, focusing on themes of class struggle and human suffering amidst the Christmas festivities. The narrative introduces various characters, including Juhmakka, a prosperous landowner, and Lois-Pietu, a character who embodies the plight of the poor and marginalized.  \"The opening of the novel vividly illustrates a wintry Christmas morning, where the extreme cold contrasts with the festive spirit of the season.\" As villagers head to church, adorned in their winter attire, the arrival of a newly donated ornamental crown for the church's altar captures everyone's attention, particularly that of Juhmakka, who sees it as a symbol of his status. However, the narrative takes a darker turn with the presence of Lois-Pietu, a pariah viewed with contempt by the townsfolk, who becomes increasingly intertwined with the story. As the day unfolds, tensions rise within the church as various characters navigate their own struggles for dignity and recognition, setting the stage for a tale that explores the complexities of social hierarchy and human connection in a harsh environment.
