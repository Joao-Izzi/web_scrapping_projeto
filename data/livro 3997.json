This volume features a rich blend of Dowson's lyrical expressions, exploring themes of love, longing, and existential reflection, alongside a memoir that gives insight into his troubled yet passionate life. The collection presents the essence of Dowson’s poetic voice, filled with melancholy beauty, a fascination with youth, and the transient nature of love.  The opening of this work introduces readers to the life and context of Ernest Dowson as portrayed in the memoir by Arthur Symons. It reflects on Dowson's legacy, highlighting his struggles with health and a yearning for connection, while also detailing his artistic journey, including his involvement with the Rhymers’ Club and his relationships.
