    "resumo": "\"Tess of the Storm Country\" by Grace Miller White is a novel written in the early 20th century. It tells the story of Tessibel Skinner, a young girl living in a squatter fishing community on the outskirts of Ithaca, New York, where her father, Orn Skinner, is a fisherfolk struggling against societal contempt and legal adversities. The narrative explores Tess's character and her experiences growing up in a harsh environment, marked by poverty and the limitations imposed by her social status.  The opening of the book introduces us to Tess and her challenging life as she navigates her relationships with the fishermen surrounding her. The men express disdain for Tess, labeling her \"cursed\" and \"wild,\" and their prejudice against her reflects the broader societal issues related to class and gender. The murky dynamics of Tessâ€™s family life, the influence of her father, and her interactions with her peers establish the key conflicts she faces. As rumors of her father's troubles with the law begin to surface, we see Tess's struggle between the loyalty to her father and the looming societal judgment that threatens their existence. This introductory segment deftly sets the stage for the unfolding drama, highlighting Tess's resilience and the precursors to her significant challenges ahead.
