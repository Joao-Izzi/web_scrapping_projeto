    "resumo": "\"Eve: A Novel\" by S. Baring-Gould is a historical fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The story begins at Morwell House, an old hunting lodge, where we are introduced to the troubled lives of Ignatius Jordan and Ezekiel Babb, two men bound by pain and the enigmatic figure of Eve, whose actions weave through their lives with tragic consequences. The narrative hints at themes of love, betrayal, and the burdens of heritage, exploring the dynamics between family and personal desires through its complex characters.  The opening of the novel sets a somber tone as Ignatius Jordan, a gaunt man, reflects on his troubled past while caring for a child in a cradle. Ezekiel Babb arrives in a fit of fury, demanding to know the whereabouts of his daughter, Eve. His anger reveals a deep-seated bitterness toward the lineage and choices that have haunted him, setting up a conflict that intertwines the fates of these characters. The stage is set for a tale filled with themes of desire, loss, and the struggle against one's lineage, as other characters—such as Barbara, Ignatius’s daughter—begin to emerge and add depth to the story's unfolding drama.
