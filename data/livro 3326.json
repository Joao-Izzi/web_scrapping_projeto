    "resumo": "\"Zanzibar; City, Island, and Coast. Vol. 2\" by Sir Richard Francis Burton is a historical travelogue and exploration account written in the late 19th century. This volume continues Burton's detailed observations and experiences as he journeys through the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly focusing on Zanzibar and Mombasa, their geography, native cultures, and the intricacies of local trade. The book likely serves to document not only the landscapes and peoples encountered but also the colonial dynamics of the period.  The opening of this volume sets the stage for Burton's expedition, which begins on January 5, 1857. He describes the daunting start of the voyage against strong winds and rough seas, detailing the rich, fertile landscapes he observes once he finally docks at Kokoto-ni. As he continues onward, Burton encounters local villages and their inhabitants, vividly painting a picture of their lifestyle, practices, and the natural beauty of the islands. The initial chapters introduce various challenges faced by the expedition team and give insight into both the local flora and fauna and cultural norms, laying a foundation for the explorations and encounters described throughout the rest of the volume.
