    "resumo": "\"Rootabaga Stories\" by Carl Sandburg is a whimsical collection of children's stories written in the early 20th century. This book invites readers into a fantastical world filled with peculiar characters and enchanting places, including the Village of Liver-and-Onions and the Village of Cream Puffs. The stories explore themes of adventure and imagination, delivered through engaging tales about individual characters, like Gimme the Ax and the Potato Face Blind Man, who embark on various journeys.  At the start of the collection, we are introduced to Gimme the Ax, who, feeling confined by the sameness of life, lets his children choose their names. This sets off a chain of events where he, along with his children Please Gimme and Ax Me No Questions, decides to leave for a mysterious land known as the Rootabaga country. Their adventure begins as they board a whimsical train that travels to magical destinations, encountering balloon pickers and circus clowns along the way. The vibrant and imaginative narrative style captures the essence of childhood wonder, creating a delightful experience for readers of all ages. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
