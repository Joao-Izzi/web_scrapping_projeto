    "resumo": "\"Fighting Without a War: An Account of Military Intervention in North Russia\" by Ralph Albertson is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book recounts the experiences of the North Russian Expeditionary Force, a largely forgotten military intervention that took place during the aftermath of World War I. It reflects on the soldiers' sentiments, the political complexities of the mission, and the dire consequences of their engagement in a conflict not formally recognized as a war.  At the start of the book, the author introduces his personal journey to North Russia as a Y.M.C.A. secretary working with the Allied forces. He outlines the composition of the expeditionary force and the chaotic situation surrounding it, including the lack of clarity regarding its purpose and objectives. Throughout his observations, he highlights the soldiers' confusion and resentment about being involved in a conflict against the Bolsheviks after the armistice with Germany had been declared. The opening establishes a tone of disillusionment as soldiers confront the grim realities of fighting a war in a foreign land, unacknowledged by their governments, and fast approaching a disastrous outcome.
