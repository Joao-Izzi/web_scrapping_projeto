    "resumo": "\"Stranded in Arcady\" by Francis Lynde is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around two main characters, Donald Prime and Lucetta Millington, who find themselves mysteriously stranded in a remote woodland area after awakening from unconsciousness. As they try to unravel the mystery of their displacement, they navigate their surroundings, engaging in both practical survival tasks and conversations that reveal their personalities and backgrounds.  At the start of the narrative, Donald Prime awakens on a sandy beach, confused and disoriented, only to realize he is not alone; a young woman, Lucetta, is nearby, equally bewildered. They quickly deduce that both were in Quebec the previous night and are puzzled by how they ended up in the wilderness. As they begin to explore their environment, find provisions, and seek explanations, hints of danger and past violence emerge, suggesting a deeper conspiracy tied to their abduction. The opening sets up a blend of adventure and mystery as the characters grapple with the challenges of survival while trying to forge a connection amid the chaos.
