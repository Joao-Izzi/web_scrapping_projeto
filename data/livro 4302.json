    "resumo": "\"Geiriadur Cymraeg a Saesneg Byr\" by Sir Owen Morgan Edwards is a bilingual dictionary written in the early 20th century. The work aims to provide support for learners of the Welsh language, particularly for those interested in the literature of the Middle Ages in Wales. The dictionary seeks to fill a gap by offering a more accessible resource for understanding Welsh words and their meanings, translated to English.  The opening portion of the dictionary introduces its purpose and origin. The author discusses his motivation for creating a Welsh-English dictionary after noticing the lack of accessible resources for Welsh literature from the period between Gruffydd ab Cynan and the Welsh Bible of 1588. He acknowledges the contributions of previous works, particularly focusing on a translation of Dr. John Davies's \"Dictionarium Britannico-Latinum\" as the foundation for his own. Edwards expresses hopes for feedback from scholars to improve this endeavor and admits the dictionary's inevitability of imperfections, emphasizing its role as a collaborative effort in the study of the Welsh language.
