    "resumo": "\"The High Hander\" by William Oliver Turner is a novel written in the early 1960s. Set against the backdrop of railroad construction in a lawless frontier town, the story centers around Jack Tesno, a troubleshooter hired to resolve escalating conflicts and restore some order amid rampant violence and corruption. The narrative hints at themes of lawlessness, personal integrity, and the complexities of human relationships, notably involving a beautiful woman named Persia Parker, whose past and influence in the town complicate matters further.  The opening portion reveals Jack Tesno as an experienced and rugged individual, reflecting on his life and assignments as he rides toward Tunneltown. He meets Whisky Willie Silverknife, a half-breed youth appointed as a deputy marshal, who struggles with his stutter and the challenges of his new role. This introductory context builds tension as Tesno is set to face not only the disruptive forces in Tunneltown but also his own conflicting feelings as he learns more about its enigmatic leader, Persia Parker. As Tesno contemplates the rough nature of his job, he is also drawn into potential romance and intrigue, highlighting the bookâ€™s blend of western adventure and character-driven drama.
