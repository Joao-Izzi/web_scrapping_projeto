    "resumo": "\"A New Subspecies of Pocket Mouse from Kansas\" by E. Raymond Hall is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. This concise work focuses on the identification and description of a newly recognized subspecies of pocket mouse, specifically the \"Perognathus flavescens cockrumi\", found in south-central Kansas and parts of Oklahoma. The text falls within the field of zoology and taxonomy, contributing to the study of mammalian biodiversity in North America.  In this publication, Hall presents detailed descriptions and comparisons of the new subspecies, highlighting its physical characteristics such as size, color, and skull structure. He differentiates \"Perognathus flavescens cockrumi\" from other subspecies by examining various specimens, discussing aspects like coloration and morphology. This work not only honors the contributions of Dr. E. Lendell Cockrum to the study of Kansas mammals but also provides a thorough analysis of the geographical distribution of this pocket mouse, contributing valuable information to the field of mammalogy and ecology.
