    "resumo": "\"Cast Upon the Breakers\" by Horatio Alger, Jr. is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the life of Rodney Ropes, a young boy who faces adversity after the loss of his family fortune due to the malfeasance of his guardian. As Rodney navigates his newfound poverty, he draws on his education and values to seek a new path in life while dealing with the challenges that come with social mobility and ethical dilemmas.  The opening of the novel introduces Rodney just as he learns about his unfortunate financial situation, forcing him to leave the comforts of his boarding school. Friends express sympathy, but Rodney's circumstances quickly become dire as he tries to find work in the bustling city of New York. He soon privately struggles with feelings of loss and dislocation while finding solace in his motherâ€™s jewelry, which he vows to keep despite its potential financial value. As he encounters individuals like the opportunistic John Bundy and the sympathetic Dr. Sampson, Rodney's character starts to develop against the backdrop of a society that often prioritizes wealth over virtue. The beginning sets the stage for Rodney's quest for independence and integrity amidst the challenges he faces. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
