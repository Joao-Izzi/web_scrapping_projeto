    "resumo": "\"The Landing of the Pilgrims\" by Henry Fisk Carlton is a historical play that dramatizes the early experiences of the Pilgrims in their quest to establish a new settlement in America during the early 17th century. Written in the early 20th century, the book portrays the challenges and negotiations faced by the Pilgrims as they journey from Leyden, Holland, to the New World, ultimately landing in what is now Massachusetts instead of their intended destination in Virginia. The text captures the essence of their religious convictions and the social dynamics at play during this pivotal moment in American history.  The narrative unfolds with the Pilgrims led by Pastor John Robinson and Elder John Carver, who weigh their emigration options amid financial constraints. Initially, they receive an enticing offer from the Dutch West India Company to settle under their flag, but they ultimately decide to accept an offer from a group of London merchants to settle under British rule. The voyage aboard the Mayflower is fraught with difficulties, including adverse weather and challenges in navigation, leading them to Cape Cod rather than Virginia. The passengers collectively decide to land and establish self-governance through the famous Mayflower Compact, laying the groundwork for their new community and setting a precedent for democratic governance in America.
