    "resumo": "\"The Life of Clara Barton, Founder of the American Red Cross (Vol. 2 of 2)\" by William E. Barton is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This volume focuses on the remarkable life of Clara Barton, particularly her role in establishing the American Red Cross and her efforts in humanitarian service during wars. The narrative showcases her tenacity and the profound impact she had on the field of war relief.  At the start of this volume, the text delves into Clara Barton's discovery of the Red Cross during her time in Europe following her own health struggles. The opening introduces her initial ignorance of the organization and outlines the lack of American involvement in the Red Cross at that time. It highlights her journey to champion humanitarian efforts, as she learned about the principles behind the Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian War and became determined to bring its ideals back to the United States, leading to her eventual advocacy for the nation's participation in the international treaty that recognized the Red Cross. This introduction sets a compelling tone for her challenges and achievements in humanitarian work. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
