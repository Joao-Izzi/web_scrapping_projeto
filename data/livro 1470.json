    "resumo": "\"The Systematic Status of Eumeces pluvialis Cope, and Noteworthy Records of Other Amphibians and Reptiles From Kansas and Oklahoma\" by Hobart M. Smith is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century, specifically in 1946. The book focuses on herpetology, detailing the systematic classification of the Eumeces pluvialis species as well as providing significant findings regarding other amphibians and reptiles in the Kansas and Oklahoma regions.  In this work, Smith presents research findings from a systematic survey aimed at enhancing the understanding of the Eumeces pluvialis, which involves the classification of distinct geographical populations and their differences. He discusses the notable behaviors, habitats, and morphological characteristics of various amphibians and reptiles, including specific examples like the Eurycea lucifuga, highlighting its first recorded sighting in Kansas. Through detailed descriptions and analyses, Smith enriches the knowledge of herpetological distribution while addressing gaps in previous literature, thereby contributing significantly to the field of natural history and herpetology.
