    "resumo": "\"The Sleeper Awakes\" by H.G. Wells is a science fiction novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Graham, a man who falls into a deep, cataleptic sleep that spans two centuries. When he awakens, he finds himself in a vastly transformed world shaped by the passage of time, technological advancements, and societal changes, thrusting him into a life replete with danger and intrigue.   At the start of the narrative, we meet Mr. Isbister, a young artist who encounters a stranger in deep despair, unable to sleep for days. The stranger reveals his emotional turmoil and intense feelings of purposelessness, which ultimately leads him to contemplate suicide. Their conversation is filled with profound reflections on life, existence, and suffering. The narrative sets a contemplative tone, highlighting the stranger's mental struggle and foreshadowing Graham's eventual plight as he slips into a trance that will stretch across the centuries. Following this, Graham's awakening brings new complexities and confrontations in a world beyond his understanding, where he must navigate not only the ramifications of his long absence but also the socio-political unrest that defines the future.
