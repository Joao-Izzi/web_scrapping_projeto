    "resumo": "\"Egmont: Viisinäytöksinen murhenäytelmä\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a tragic play written in the late 18th century. The drama explores themes of power, freedom, and the individual versus authority, focusing on the character of Count Egmont, a nobleman caught between his loyalty to the crown and the looming struggles of his people against oppressive rule. The story takes place in a historical context surrounding the political unrest in the Low Countries.  The opening of the play sets the stage in Brussels, where a group of citizens and soldiers engage in a lively conversation about their king and the recent military accomplishments of Count Egmont. A sense of camaraderie exists among the townsfolk, celebrating Egmont as a beloved leader who represents their concerns. However, hints of discontent with the royal authority begin to emerge as discussions of freedom and oppression unfold among the townspeople. The scene transitions to the palace, introducing the character of Duchess Margareta, who grapples with her own anxieties about the political unrest and the king’s expectations, foreshadowing the tension and complexity of the narrative that will follow.
