    "resumo": "\"Amor ja Psyke\" by Apuleius is a novel that was likely written in the late antique period. This work intertwines elements of mythology and allegory and centers around the love story of its main characters, Amor (Cupid) and Psyke, exploring themes of beauty, jealousy, and the trials of love.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Psyke, a remarkably beautiful princess, whose beauty incites the ire of the goddess Venus, who feels overshadowed. To take revenge, Venus commands her son Cupid to make Psyke fall in love with a lowly creature. Meanwhile, Psyke's parents, troubled by the oracle's prophecy of her fate, prepare for her to be sacrificed to a monster. However, Psyke's fate takes a turn when she is whisked away to a magical palace where she is cared for by unseen spirits and visits with her husband, whom she cannot see. This rich tapestry of events and emotions sets in motion the challenges that the couple must face, symbolizing the trials inherent in love and desire. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
