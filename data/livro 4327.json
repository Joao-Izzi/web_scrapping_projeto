    "resumo": "\"Os jardins ou a arte de aformosear as paisagens: Poema\" by Jacques Delille is a didactic poem written in the early 19th century. The work reflects on the art of gardening and the beauty of landscapes, emphasizing the relationship between nature and human creativity. Through a lyrical exploration of gardens, it discusses the philosophical and aesthetic principles that should guide landscape design.  The beginning of the poem introduces the author’s purpose to harmonize the joy of nature with artistic expression. Delille acknowledges the realm of garden art and the writers who influenced him, expressing his anxiety about presenting his work amidst seasoned voices. He aims to capture the beauty of gardens while incorporating the emotional responses they evoke. The prologue sets a tone of respect for nature, suggesting that a true artist should imitate rather than overly manipulate the natural world. The opening themes suggest a deep appreciation for the balance between nature’s wild beauty and the refined elegance that artistic intervention can create.
