    "resumo": "\"Un avvocato dell'avvenire\" by Valentino Carrera is a comedic play written in the late 19th century. The work satirically explores the Italian legal profession through the character of Tullio Savelli, an ambitious young man who aspires to be a lawyer despite his apparent shortcomings and lack of genuine dedication to the law. The play is set against a backdrop of societal mockery and serves as a reflection on the legal system and the nature of ambition in a rapidly changing society.  The opening of the play introduces the main character, Tullio, and presents the contrast between his grand aspirations and his superficial understanding of the legal profession. Tullio arrives in the city, filled with pretentiousness and misguided confidence, yet he acknowledges his lack of genuine academic effort. The comical setting reveals Tullio's interactions with various characters, including his uncle Giuseppe and other aspiring lawyers, who represent different facets of the legal realm. Amidst the humor, Carrera critically examines societal values, ambition, and the ease with which one can navigate the legal landscape, setting the stage for Tullio's subsequent adventures and misadventures in court and in love.
