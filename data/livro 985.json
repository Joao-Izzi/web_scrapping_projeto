    "resumo": "\"The Story of My Struggles: The Memoirs of Arminius Vambéry, Volume 2\" by Vámbéry is a historical memoir written in the early 20th century. This volume continues the life narrative of the author, who was an influential scholar and traveler known for his extensive work in Oriental studies. The book specifically explores Vambéry's experiences during and after his travels in Central Asia, reflecting on his political engagements and the cultural contrasts he faced when he returned to Hungary.  The opening of this memoir describes Vambéry's return to Hungary after a successful reception in England. He reflects on his decision to prioritize a quieter academic life despite his potential for a more dynamic career in political diplomacy, as well as the challenges he faced in gaining acceptance in his homeland after years abroad. He discusses the stark contrast between his reception in England and the skepticism he received from various circles in Hungary, revealing the complexities of identity, ambition, and cultural appreciation. His recounting of these experiences introduces themes of belonging, societal expectations, and the struggle for recognition in a post-imperial context. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
