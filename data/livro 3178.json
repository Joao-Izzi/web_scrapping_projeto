    "resumo": "\"The Great Revival of the Eighteenth Century\" by Edwin Paxton Hood is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book examines the transformative religious movement that swept across England during the 1700s, primarily highlighting the contributions of key figures such as John Wesley and George Whitefield. It delves into three major evangelical revivals in England, emphasizing their profound effects on society and culture, as well as the revival's expansions into America.  The opening of the book sets the stage by describing the societal context in which the Great Revival emerged, outlining a time when England was steeped in spiritual darkness and moral decay. Hood illustrates the stark contrasts between the previous religious awakenings, such as the Reformation and Puritanism, and the quieter but equally significant influence of the 18th-century movement. The narrative begins by recounting the dire state of England before the revival: widespread immorality, corruption, and indifference towards religion. Hood posits that the revival offered a much-needed spiritual awakening and moral reformation, paving the way for a renewed interest in religious fervor and piety that would eventually reshape the landscape of English Christianity.
