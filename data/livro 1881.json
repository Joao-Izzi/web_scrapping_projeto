Haines is a detailed account of life in ancient civilizations, specifically focusing on the cultures of Egypt, Greece, and Italy, and is likely written in the late 19th century.

It points out the significance of archaeological discoveries, particularly those from Pompeii, which have revealed stunning details about urban life before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This introduction emphasizes a commitment to presenting factual observations while fostering curiosity among readers about ancient civilizations, and it outlines a structured approach to discussing key themes, from the domestic arrangements in homes to the broader context of cultural and historical developments.
