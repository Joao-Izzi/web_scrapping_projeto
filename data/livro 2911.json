    "resumo": "\"Tre racconti sentimentali\" by Paolo Bettoni is a collection of short stories written in the mid-19th century. The stories explore themes of virtue, vice, and the struggles of the impoverished in Milan during challenging social conditions. The prominent characters are often weak individuals grappling with moral dilemmas, as seen through the lens of their societal contexts.  The opening portion introduces the first story, \"Vizio, Miseria e Virt√π,\" set in a dilapidated tenement in Milan, characterized by its grim and unsanitary conditions. We are introduced to Tribolo, an elderly tenant who has survived numerous hardships yet engages in unscrupulous acts such as usury. His interactions with other residents, including a destitute mason's family grappling with sudden loss and poverty, unfold against a backdrop of despair and moral complexity. The narrative hints at the struggle for survival faced by the tenants, especially young Cecilia, who becomes a target of exploitation by Tribolo and another character, the wealthy shopkeeper, thereby exploring the intricate relationship between poverty and moral degradation.
