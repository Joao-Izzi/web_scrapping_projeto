    "resumo": "\"Räisäspoika\" by Juhana Kokko is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around a young boy named Antti, also known as Räisäspoika, who navigates the challenges of life in rural Finland, grappling with his origins and societal expectations. Themes of poverty, crime, and the quest for identity permeate his journey, as he dreams of a life that transcends his troubled beginnings.  The opening of the novel sets a bleak backdrop, depicting the stark, cold winter nights of the North as young Antti listens to the stories of Suutari-Elkko, a shoemaker who captivates his imagination with tales of thieves and freedom. As Antti absorbs these stories, he reflects on his own tragic past, including the loss of his parents and the stigma of being related to a family of thieves. The narrative poignantly captures his longing for adventure, the conflict between his upbringing and desires, and foreshadows his later entanglements with crime, all while maintaining an innocent yearning for a better life.
