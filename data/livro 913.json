    "resumo": "\"The Riddle Club at Sunrise Beach: How they toured to the shore, what happenedâ€¦\" by Alice Dale Hardy is a children's adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the members of the Riddle Club, a group of friends consisting of Jess, Polly, Margy, Fred, Artie, and Ward, as they embark on their summer vacation to Sunrise Beach. Their adventures include solving riddles, navigating challenges, and engaging in festive activities, all set against the backdrop of the beach and the Fourth of July celebrations.  At the start of the narrative, the children discuss the oppressive heat and their excitement about their upcoming trip to Sunrise Beach. They hold an informal meeting in the attic barn of the Larue family, where they express their enthusiasm for the beach, illustrate camaraderie, and engage in riddles. However, the mood shifts dramatically when they discover that a package of fireworks intended for the Fourth of July has been destroyed in an accident caused by a rival club member, Joe Anderson. Concerned about having no fireworks for the celebration, the Riddle Club rallies together to procure supplies, setting the stage for the adventures that will unfold throughout their stay at the beach.
