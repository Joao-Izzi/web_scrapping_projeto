    "resumo": "\"The Englishwoman in Russia: Impressions of the Society and Manners of the Russians at Home\" by A Lady is a travel narrative written in the mid-19th century. This account explores the author's observations and reflections from her ten years spent living in Russia, particularly focusing on the country's customs, societal structures, and the contrasts between Russian public and private lives. The author aims to provide insights into the lesser-known aspects of Russian domestic life, which were often overlooked by foreigners.  At the start of the narrative, the author describes her journey from England to Archangel, setting the scene with vivid descriptions of the landscape and the native populations, including the Samo√Ødes. She shares her experiences and impressions of Archangel, a town she finds dreary and uninviting but inhabited by a culture rich in traditions. The writer contrasts the Russian way of life with her expectations and discusses various social customs, such as the treatment of serfs, the character of the Russian people, and the complexities of their societal norms. This opening section establishes a strong sense of place and cultural exploration, inviting readers to delve deeper into the unique observations the author will unravel throughout her narrative.
