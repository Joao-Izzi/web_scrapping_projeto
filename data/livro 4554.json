    "resumo": "\"A Selection from the Comedies of Marivaux\" by Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux is a compilation of notable comedic works written in the early 18th century. The collection emphasizes the themes of love and social interaction, featuring Marivaux's signature exploration of the intricate dynamics between characters. Notable plays included in this edition are \"Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard,\" \"Le Legs,\" and \"Les Fausses Confidences,\" showcasing his uniquely delicate and sophisticated prose style.  The opening of this selection introduces Marivaux, noting the absence of his works in English-speaking contexts despite his significant contributions to drama. It provides a biographical overview of the author, detailing his early life, education, and the influences on his writing. Marivaux's keen observations of society and relationships, along with his gentle critique of social norms and the nature of love, are set as key themes to be explored in the selected comedies, hinting at the witty dialogue and intricate characters that define his artistry. This preface serves to establish Marivaux not only as a master of comedy but also as a poignant commentator on the human experience, making this collection appealing for readers interested in classic literature and social commentary.
