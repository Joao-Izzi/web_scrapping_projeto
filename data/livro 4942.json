    "resumo": "\"The Tale of the Argonauts\" by Apollonius of Rhodes is an ancient epic poem that chronicles the legendary voyage of Jason and his cadre of heroes as they seek the Golden Fleece. Likely written in the Hellenistic period, the text delves into themes of adventure, heroism, and the influence of the gods on human fate. The central figure is Jason, who is compelled to undertake this perilous journey by King Pelias, setting the stage for grand adventures filled with gods, mythical creatures, and heroic trials.  At the start of the narrative, the poet invokes the Muses and sets the scene with an oracle warning King Pelias of a doom that will come to him through a sandal-wearing hero. Jason, having lost one sandal during a crossing, is revealed as the fated hero. The first book introduces an array of legendary characters who join him on his quest for the Fleece, including the musician Orpheus and the formidable Herakles. As the heroes assemble, they prepare for their journey by launching the ship Argo amid a backdrop of both anticipation and foreboding, with the heavy emotions of parting from their homes and loved ones. The opening lays a rich foundation for the epic's exploration of camaraderie, agency, and the trials faced on the open seas. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
