    "resumo": "\"Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. LXVIII, Sept.â€¦\" is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The work focuses on the engineering and construction processes involved in the New York Tunnel Extension of the Pennsylvania Railroad, specifically detailing the North River Tunnels. The publication likely serves as a professional reference for civil engineers and construction professionals, providing detailed insights into tunnel design, construction methodologies, and the challenges encountered during the project.  The opening of the document introduces a paper authored by B. H. M. Hewett and W. L. Brown, which describes the section of the Pennsylvania Railroad Tunnel between New York City and Weehawken, New Jersey. The introduction highlights the significance of this tunnel as it crosses the Hudson River, facilitating railroad access to terminal stations in New York City. The paper aims to present the actual designs, construction methods, and conditions encountered in the field, categorizing the information under four main subjects: Shafts, Plant, Land Tunnels, and River Tunnels. It sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the engineering techniques employed in this notable infrastructure project. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
