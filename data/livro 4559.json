    "resumo": "\"The Supposed Autographa of John the Scot\" by Edward Kennard Rand is a scholarly publication written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the manuscript tradition surrounding John the Scot's writings, particularly focusing on his philosophical text, \"De Divisione Naturae.\" The book examines the analysis of marginal notes and corrections made in various manuscripts, considering the implications for understanding authorship during the medieval period.  In the book, Rand investigates the series of manuscripts associated with John the Scot, presenting evidence that the marginal notes thought to be his may not actually be in his hand. He outlines the different scribal hands observed in the manuscripts from places like Reims, Laon, and Bamberg, suggesting a collaborative effort between scribes who corrected and added to Scot's works. Rand ultimately challenges the notion of identifying the true autograph of John the Scot while emphasizing the importance of these revisions in grasping the evolution of Scot's thoughts and the task ahead for editors in presenting an accurate and comprehensive view of his writings.
