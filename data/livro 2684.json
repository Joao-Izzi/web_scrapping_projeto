This book serves as a record of the group's excursions and findings in central Illinois, particularly around mounds and ancient sites associated with Native American history. It encapsulates both the enthusiasm of amateur archaeologists and a dedication to preserving the cultural heritage of the area.  The content of the book primarily consists of first-hand accounts of expeditions undertaken by the members of the Kickapoo Club, detailing their findings of various artifacts, such as flint tools, pottery, and remnants from burial sites. These explorations are not just about the physical discoveries; they also weave in narratives of the history and significance of the areas they investigated, like the great Cahokia Mound. The descriptions reveal a deep appreciation for the Native American history, showcasing the connection between the land and its original inhabitants, while emphasizing the need for preservation efforts against encroaching modern development.
