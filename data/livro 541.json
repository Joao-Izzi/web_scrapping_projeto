    "resumo": "\"Revolted Woman: Past, Present, and to Come\" by Charles G. Harper is a sociocultural critique written in the late 19th century. The text explores themes of gender roles and women's liberation, addressing the emergence of the \"New Woman\" and her confrontation with traditional male authority. Harper's work is characterized by a strong perspective on women's aspirations for independence and equality within a societal framework that has historically relegated them to secondary positions.  At the start of the text, the author introduces the concept of the \"Emancipated Woman,\" highlighting her advancements toward equal rights and the challenges she poses to traditional gender norms. Harper discusses various movements contributing to this modern identity, including dress reform and women's participation in politics, while sarcastically critiquing the absurdities he perceives in their quest for equality. Through vivid examples of historical female figures and contemporary social observations, he illustrates the complexities of the evolving role of women, revealing a deep skepticism regarding their ability to maintain conventional moral standards amidst their newfound freedoms.
