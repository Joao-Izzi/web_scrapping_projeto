    "resumo": "\"Ihmisen velvollisuudet\" by Giuseppe Mazzini is a philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century. The text presents Mazzini's reflections on moral duties and responsibilities, particularly focusing on the Italian working class and their role in societal progress and national unity. Through this work, Mazzini seeks to inspire a sense of duty towards God, humanity, the homeland, and family, highlighting the importance of ethical commitment as a foundation for a just society.  At the start of the treatise, Mazzini addresses the Italian working class, framing their struggles within the broader context of national identity and empowerment. He emphasizes the significance of recognizing one's responsibilities over merely grasping at individual rights, arguing that true freedom and progress emerge through collective sacrifice and moral development. Mazzini recounts his journey of dedication to the cause of a united and democratic Italy, and he implores his readers to reject materialism and self-interest in favor of a higher moral purpose, urging them to work tirelessly for the greater good of society.
