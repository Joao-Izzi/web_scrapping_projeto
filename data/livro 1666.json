    "resumo": "\"WILD WINGS: A ROMANCE OF YOUTH\" by Margaret Rebecca Piper is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story introduces a cast of characters centered around Tony Holiday, a talented young actress, as she navigates the complexities of love, ambition, and family expectations in a New England setting. The narrative explores themes of youth, the arts, and societal pressures, making it a poignant reflection on the coming-of-age experience during this period.  The opening of the novel presents two contrasting characters on a train—Max Hempel, a seasoned stage manager, and Richard \"Dick\" Carson, a young reporter—each captivated by a photograph of Antoinette \"Tony\" Holiday, who is set to star in a college production of \"As You Like It.\" Max is skeptical about Tony's prospects because of her lineage as the daughter of a renowned actress, while Dick harbors deep affections for her, feeling insecure about his own status compared to her potential stardom. As the train approaches its destination, Tony's strong personality and the admiration she inspires in those around her come into focus, setting the stage for her journey through the romantic and professional challenges that lie ahead.
