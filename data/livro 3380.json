    "resumo": "\"Mind Worms\" by Moses Schere is a science fiction novella published in the late 1940s. The story takes place in a future where Earth has begun to make contact with alien civilizations, particularly a species residing on Venus, which is rumored to be superior in intellect. The book explores themes of fear, the inferiority complex experienced by humans when faced with more advanced beings, and the nature of communication between different species.  The plot centers around an ambassador from Earth traveling to Venus, where communication and understanding with the Venusians become paramount. As he prepares for his landing, he reflects on past encounters with aliens, particularly an old space traveler named Rupert Hoag, who shares a chilling story about glowing, worm-like creatures that they encountered in space. The ambassador grapples with his fear and insecurities about meeting a race that may be vastly more powerful, realizing that previous encounters have left humans psychologically scarred. Ultimately, the story concludes with the ambassador adopting a more confident stance, recognizing that he has time to navigate this new relationship rather than succumbing to panic and fear, thus shifting the perspective on interspecies diplomacy.
