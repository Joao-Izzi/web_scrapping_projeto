    "resumo": "\"Az Atlasz-család\" by Gergely Csiky is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the life and ambitions of the Atlasz family, particularly focusing on the character of Atlasz Samu, a wealthy landowner struggling with the societal pressures and expectations tied to his newfound fortune and status. The plot seems to explore themes of family dynamics, class struggles, and the significance of legacy in the context of Hungarian society.  At the start of the novel, the elderly Atlasz Samu and his wife Rozália are preoccupied with planning a surprise gift for their son Sándor's name day. Their discussions reveal a blend of their social standing—a wealthy landowner appreciating the finer things in life, yet reflecting on their origins. Sándor returns from a trip with a surprise of his own, stating his intention to marry Boglár Klára, which elicits strong reactions from his parents due to their concerns regarding her background. The opening sets the stage for a familial conflict grounded in tradition versus modern aspirations, hinting at deeper societal questions about class and acceptance.
