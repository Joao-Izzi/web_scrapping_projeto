    "resumo": "\"Color Standards and Color Nomenclature\" by Robert Ridgway is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book aims to establish a standardized nomenclature for colors to aid various industries and scientific disciplines in their communication of color variations. It compiles an extensive reference of 1,115 named colors, complemented by 53 colored plates that visually illustrate the gamut of hues.  The opening of the work begins with a preface outlining the author's motivations for creating a comprehensive system to standardize colors and their names. Ridgway emphasizes the chaos in current color nomenclature and the importance of clear communication among naturalists and other professionals who rely on precise color descriptions. He explains the systematic arrangement of colors based on the solar spectrum and offers insights into the challenges he faced during the preparation of this reference, including unifying diverse sources of color names and ensuring accurate representation of colors through meticulous experimentation with dyes and pigments. This sets the stage for the detailed classification and visual representation that follow in the subsequent sections of the book. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
