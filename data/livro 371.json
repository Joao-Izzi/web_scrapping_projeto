    "resumo": "\"The Maker of Rainbows and Other Fairy-tales and Fables\" by Richard Le Gallienne is a collection of fairy tales and fables written in the early 20th century. The stories explore themes of hope, transformation, and the magic of the ordinary world, with narratives that often feature whimsical characters who encounter profound moments of change or revelation. Prominent figures include a kind-hearted knife-grinder who creates rainbows and a struggling poet, emphasizing the interplay between dreams and reality.  The opening of the collection introduces us to a dreary village named Twelve-trees, perpetually burdened by hardship and despair. As the villagers wallow in their gloom, they encounter a mysterious old man who possesses an extraordinary wheel that transforms tears into vibrant rainbows, igniting joy in the hearts of children and revealing beauty in overlooked lives. This old man's magical abilities stir the villagers' belief in hope, triggering their quest for a metaphorical “pot of gold” at the end of the rainbow, thereby setting the stage for the exploration of deeper themes regarding perception, hope, and the power of imagination that flows throughout the tales.
