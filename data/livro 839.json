    "resumo": "\"The Answer\" by George O. Smith is a science fiction novella written in the late 1940s. The story revolves around a tense confrontation between a dictator, Robert Hohmann, and a representative of the United Nations, Greg Hammond, as they debate the ethical and political implications of nuclear power and weapons. It explores themes of power, democracy, and the consequences of unchecked ambition in a world on the brink of nuclear catastrophe.  In the narrative, Hohmann plans to construct a plutonium-producing uranium pile, defying the cautions of Hammond, who warns him about the dire repercussions of his actions. As Hohmann's project progresses, he becomes increasingly paranoid about opposition and potential sabotage. Tension escalates when a series of unexpected fires and radioactivity issues arise, leading to the revelation that the paper in government offices has become dangerous due to radiation from the new pile. Ultimately, Hammond makes it clear that Hohmann's reckless decision to proceed will have catastrophic consequences not only for him but for the entire country, illustrating the fragile balance between individual power and the collective responsibility to prevent disaster.
