    "resumo": "\"Amphibians and Reptiles in Captivity\" by Tom R. Johnson, Robert N. Bader, and Donald J. Coxwell is a scientific publication written in the mid-1970s. The book focuses on the care and maintenance of various species of amphibians and reptiles when kept in captivity, addressing the increasing interest in these animals as pets. Through instructional guidance, it aims to provide essential knowledge for enthusiasts to ensure the well-being of their captive creatures.  The book begins with an introduction that highlights the lack of proper information available to pet owners and the authors' intent to fill this gap. It systematically covers various groups of amphibians and reptiles, including salamanders, toads and frogs, turtles, lizards, and snakes, offering insights into their natural habitats, specific care requirements, and dietary needs. Each section provides practical advice on housing, feeding, and maintaining the health of these animals, emphasizing the importance of understanding each speciesâ€™ unique needs. The authors also caution against the pitfalls of keeping certain more challenging or endangered species, thereby promoting responsible ownership and conservation.
