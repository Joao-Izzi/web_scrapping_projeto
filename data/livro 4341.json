    "resumo": "\"E. K. Means\" by E. K. Means is a collection of stories centering on African American life in the South, likely written in the early 20th century. The book showcases the humor and character of its protagonists, particularly Figger Bush, a lazy yet endearing man, as he navigates the social complexities and relationships within his community. Themes of race, culture, and the changes in post-Civil War Southern life are explored through entertaining narratives that highlight the rich dialect and unique perspectives of the characters.  The opening of the book introduces readers to Figger Bush, a carefree man who is faced with the impending visit of his long-lost grandfather, Popsy Spout. Figger is apprehensive about the visit because he has little to offer Popsy and fears he may become a burden. As he confides in his friends, Skeeter Butts and Vinegar Atts, they hatch a humorous plan for Figger to fake his death to avoid his grandfatherâ€™s expectations. The interaction between these characters sets a lively tone, filled with witty banter and dialect, all while establishing the comedic and heartfelt undertones that will likely permeate the rest of the stories.
