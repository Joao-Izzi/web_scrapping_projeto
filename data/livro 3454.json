    "resumo": "\"A bűvös erszény és egyéb elbeszélések\" by Gyula Krúdy is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The collection opens with the title story, which features the character Ede Viczky, a seemingly wealthy yet peculiar man known for his mysterious and inexhaustible purse filled with gold and silver coins. The narrative intertwines themes of wealth, pride, and social perception within a richly atmospheric setting.  The beginning of the story introduces us to Viczky Eduárd, a man of notable yet questionable wealth, who is known for carelessly tossing gold coins around at social events. Despite his apparent riches, he demonstrates a disregard for social responsibility and a detachment from the struggles of those around him. Accompanied by a curious cast of characters, including his son Gábor and an unrefined entourage, Viczky lives in a state of whimsical indulgence. Gábor, a seemingly innocent child with a heavy heart, navigates the chaos of his father's world while carrying the shadow of his missing mother. This complex dynamic sets the stage for exploration of familial bonds, wealth's impact on happiness, and the pursuit of meaning in a decadent lifestyle.
