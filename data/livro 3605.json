    "resumo": "\"Otherwise Phyllis\" by Meredith Nicholson is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story opens with the Kirkwood family, consisting of father Tom and his daughter, Phil, as they prepare to leave their camping site along Turkey Run, establishing a close and affectionate relationship between them. The narrative sets the stage for Phil Kirkwood, an eighteen-year-old girl who defies the expectations of her conservative aunts while navigating her youth and independence in the small town of Montgomery, Indiana.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Philâ€™s playful and adventurous spirit, contrasting with her father's more somber moods as they pack up their camping gear. Their banter illustrates their strong bond, while hints of familial pressures from aunts seeking to impose traditional values on Phil become apparent. As Phil explores the surrounding landscape, her curiosity leads her to a distant barn where a party is taking place, further highlighting her desire for excitement and adventure. The initial interactions and vibrant characterization suggest a deeper exploration of themes related to individuality, family dynamics, and societal expectations as the story unfolds.
