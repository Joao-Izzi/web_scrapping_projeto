    "resumo": "\"Balgatag szerelem: Elbeszélések\" by Gábor Oláh is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century.\" The narratives explore themes of love and desire, often through complex relationships involving the main characters, who find themselves entangled in emotional turbulence and jealousy. Set against a backdrop of a sanatorium, the longing and heartache resonate with readers who appreciate introspective storytelling.  The opening of this work introduces a contemplative atmosphere, where the narrator finds himself on the terrace of a grand sanatorium, surrounded by beautiful but melancholic scenery. As he observes the evening's enchanting colors and the haunting beauty of a sorrowful woman nearby, he reflects on his isolation and proximity to death. Soon, he becomes enthralled by a new arrival—a mysterious and alluring young woman named Laura, a doctor in training. Their subsequent interactions reveal a budding connection shadowed by romantic turmoil, jealousy, and the complexities of unrequited love, laying the groundwork for deeper explorations of these themes in the stories to come.
