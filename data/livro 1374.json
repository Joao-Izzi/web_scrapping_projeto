    "resumo": "\"Shavings & Scrapes from Many Parts\" by Jules Joubert is a collection of autobiographical anecdotes and reflections written in the late 19th century. The book presents the author's diverse experiences and encounters during his travels across various regions, including Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, and India. Through his recollections, Joubert captures the essence of life in these places, while also providing insights into the cultural and historical contexts in which he lived.  The opening of the work begins with a prelude dedicating it to members of the Savage Club in Dunedin, New Zealand, hinting at the author's social connections. Joubert introduces himself by recounting his lineage and childhood, providing a glimpse of his family history, particularly the military background of his ancestors. He contrasts his upbringing with his later travels, humorously detailing moments of youthful mischief and folly during his education in Bordeaux. The narrative shifts towards his adventurous spirit, and the seeds of his wanderlust are sown, setting the stage for his travels that would span numerous countries and cultures, detailed in the subsequent chapters.
