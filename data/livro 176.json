    "resumo": "\"Diary of Samuel Pepys — Complete 1669 N.S.\" by Samuel Pepys is a historical account written in the late 17th century. This work serves as a personal diary in which Pepys chronicles the daily events of his life as a prominent civil servant in the English Navy during a transformative period in British history. The diary offers not just a glimpse into Pepys' personal experiences but also insights into the social, political, and cultural context of the time.  At the start of the diary, Pepys documents a series of daily activities in the transition from the year 1668 to 1669. The entries showcase a mix of domestic life—such as dining with family and attending plays—with professional concerns, including interactions at government offices and discussions about naval affairs. Pepys reflects on personal relationships, particularly with his wife, while also navigating his role at court. The opening provides a fascinating introduction to the minutiae of daily life, interspersed with moments of reflection, contributing to a vivid and intimate portrayal of a man's life against the backdrop of historical events.
