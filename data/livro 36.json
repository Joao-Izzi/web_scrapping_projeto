    "resumo": "\"The Complete Works of Artemus Ward — Part 3: Stories and Romances\" by Artemus Ward (the pen name of Charles Farrar Browne) is a collection of humorous short stories and romances that reflect the comedic style prevalent during the mid-19th century, particularly in the United States. Written in a satirical and often irreverent tone, the book captures various societal themes and characters, showcasing the quirks of love, fate, and human nature in a light-hearted manner. The stories draw on elements of romance and farce, blending different literary techniques and narrative forms typical of the time.  The collection features a variety of stories, including \"Moses the Sassy,\" where a fireman grapples with his noble lineage, and \"Marion,\" which delves into the complexities of love amidst societal constraints. Through characters like William Barker, who must prove his worth for love, and Reginald Gloverson, whose unfortunate demise leaves his many wives in turmoil, Ward crafts narratives that elicit both laughter and reflection. Each tale is imbued with absurdity, wit, and a keen observation of human folly, making it a delightful read for those interested in classic American humor and storytelling.
