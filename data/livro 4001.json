    "resumo": "\"Palimpsest\" by Roger D. Aycock is a science fiction novel written during the early 1950s. The narrative explores themes of human origin, survival, and identity as it follows a crew of Earthmen who embark on a mission to colonize Venus after Earth has been destroyed. The title suggests the layers of history and identity that may exist within different worlds, drawing a parallel between the physical journey into space and the broader philosophical questions of humanityâ€™s place in the universe.  In the storyline, the crew of the spaceship Terra IV, led by Val Conna, discovers that they are not alone on Venus as they initially believed; they encounter a group of human descendants from a previous mission, the Connors. Throughout their journey, tension arises between the crew and Hanlon, a menacing stowaway who is struggling with his identity and purpose after being discharged from the Foundation's training program. As they grapple with the consequences of their mission and the destruction of Earth, they must confront both their individual insecurities and the implications of creating a new human race, concluding with a discovery about their origins that challenges their preconceived notions of humanity.
