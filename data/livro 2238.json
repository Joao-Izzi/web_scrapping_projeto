    "resumo": "\"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare is a tragic play written in the early 17th century. The story revolves around Prince Hamlet of Denmark, who is grappling with profound grief and existential turmoil following his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage to his uncle Claudius, who has now ascended to the throne. As Hamlet navigates themes of revenge, madness, and moral corruption, the play delves into complex questions about life, death, and the nature of fate.  The opening of \"Hamlet\" introduces a tense atmosphere, beginning with sentinels on watch who discuss the appearance of a ghost resembling the deceased King Hamlet. This ghost haunts the battlements of Elsinore Castle and causes anxiety among the guards, who invite Horatio, Hamlet’s friend, to witness this perplexing apparition. The ghost's appearance heralds ominous events, setting the stage for the unfolding drama in which Hamlet must confront the unsettling truths of his father's murder by his uncle. The initial scenes also establish the political tensions in Denmark and Hamlet’s introspective struggles, foreshadowing the tragic events that will follow as he seeks to uncover the truth.
