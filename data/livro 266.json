    "resumo": "\"Mind Amongst the Spindles\" is a collection of writings produced by factory girls, specifically those working in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, in the mid-19th century. This unique compilation reflects the thoughts, aspirations, and experiences of these young women, portraying their lives and the dignity of their labor against a backdrop of industrialization. The contributors express a range of sentiments, from the joys of community and personal growth to the challenges and discontent faced in factory life.  At the start of this work, specific characters and their narratives begin to emerge, particularly focusing on a young woman named Abby, who pleads to her parents for permission to leave home and work in the Lowell mills. Abby's excitement is palpable as she dreams of a new life filled with opportunity and the allure of fashion, but her parents harbor concerns for her well-being and moral guidance. The opening chapters set a poignant tone, highlighting the familial tensions caused by societal changes, while also introducing broader themes of independence, self-discovery, and the complex emotions woven into the experience of laboring women during a transformative time in American history.
