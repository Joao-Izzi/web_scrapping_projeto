    "resumo": "\"Arthurian Chronicles: Roman de Brut\" by Wace is a historical account likely written in the 12th century, specifically around the year 1155. This work is a metrical retelling of Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae,\" detailing the legendary tales of King Arthur and the formation of Britain. The narrative unfolds the journey of Arthurian figures, including notable characters such as Uther Pendragon, Merlin, and the treacherous Vortigern, as they navigate themes of kingship, betrayal, and the quest for identity amidst the tumult of their times.  At the start of this chronicle, the backdrop of political upheaval sets the stage as the Britons face challenges from within and outside their kingdom. After the sudden death of King Constantine, the power dynamics shift, giving rise to Vortigern's manipulation and the subsequent emergence of his adversaries, the sons of Constantine, who seek to reclaim their rightful place. As Vortigern grapples with his treachery, the narrative introduces Merlin, a pivotal character whose prophecies foreshadow the turmoil ahead. This opening portion masterfully blends history and myth, establishing a rich context in which the legendary tales of Arthur and his contemporaries are recounted, setting the groundwork for the adventures and conflicts that follow.
