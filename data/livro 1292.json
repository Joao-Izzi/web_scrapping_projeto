    "resumo": "\"La femme auteur; ou, les inconvéniens de la célébrité, tome I\" by Mme. Dufrénoy is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story centers around Anaïs, the daughter of Auguste, comte de Crécy, and explores themes of female ambition, societal expectations, and the complexities of love and creativity. Against the backdrop of a patriarchal society, the narrative examines Anaïs’s aspirations and her longing for recognition, captured poignantly through her interactions with her family and friends.  The opening of the novel introduces us to the main characters and establishes the social dynamics within which they operate. Auguste, the comte, is portrayed as a benevolent figure who holds traditional views on gender roles, believing that men are created to command while women should be subservient. His daughter Anaïs, from a young age, expresses a desire for glory akin to that of great poets, particularly Racine. This yearning culminates in a moment of embarrassment and revelation when Anaïs, at a fragile age, realizes that her aspirations clash with societal norms. The narrative sets the stage for her growth as a character, her educational pursuits, and the emerging conflicts between her desires and the realities expected of women of her time.
