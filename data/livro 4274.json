    "resumo": "\"Lonesome Town\" by E. S. Dorrance and James French Dorrance is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows Peter \"Why-Not\" Pape, a cowboy from Montana, as he navigates the lively yet alien world of New York City after arriving in search of new experiences. The book explores themes of aspiration, identity, and the contrasts between the simplicity of the Western frontier and the complexity of urban life.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Peter Pape, who takes a moment to catch his breath after riding through a gorge. Despite his rugged exterior and cheerful demeanor, he wrestles with deep-seated disappointments. As he moves through Central Park on his quirky horse, Polkadot, tensions arise when a police officer confronts him for straying off the designated horse paths, leading to a humorous exchange that highlights Pape's bewilderment at city life. This initial scene sets the stage for Pape's journey of self-discovery and his yearning for connection and fulfillment in the bustling metropolis. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
