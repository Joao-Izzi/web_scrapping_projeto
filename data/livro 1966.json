    "resumo": "\"Aesthetic Poetry\" by Walter Pater is an analytical essay written in the late 19th century that explores the concept of aestheticism in poetry, focusing primarily on its evolution and characteristics. This work examines how aesthetic poetry differs from previous poetic forms, emphasizing its capacity to transcend mere reality and evoke an idealized experience that combines elements from Greek, medieval, and modern influences. Pater's writing delves into the emotional nuances and artistic intricacies that define aesthetic poetry, presenting it as an art form embodying beauty and sensory experience.  In the essay, Pater discusses various themes and poets who embody the aesthetic spirit, particularly the intersection of love, beauty, and the fleeting nature of life. He analyzes works ranging from William Morrisâ€™s \"The Defence of Guenevere\" to the timeless allure of the medieval poetic tradition, suggesting a complex dialogue between romantic ideals and a newfound clarity in the portrayal of human emotions. Pater's exploration highlights the tension between passionate longing and the contemplative appreciation of beauty, portraying aesthetic poetry as a reflection of deeper psychological and artistic aspirations that contrast with the harsher realities of life. Through this, Pater presents a rich, layered understanding of poetry that seeks to elevate both the emotional and sensory experience of existence. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
