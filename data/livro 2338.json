    "resumo": "\"Ibong Adarna\" by Anonymous is a traditional Filipino epic poem likely written in the late 19th century. This narrative centers around the journey of three royal brothers—Don Pedro, Don Diego, and Don Juan—as they search for the mythical Adarna bird, whose song has the power to heal their ailing father, King Fernando. The tale explores themes of betrayal, sacrifice, and the quest for redemption.  The opening of the poem introduces the three brothers and their royal lineage from the Kingdom of Berbania, ruled by King Fernando and Queen Valeriana. As the story unfolds, we learn that the king falls gravely ill due to a haunting dream involving his youngest son, Don Juan, who is tragically wronged by his elder siblings. Prompted by the king’s need for healing through the song of the Adarna bird, Don Pedro is the first to embark on the quest. However, the narrative hints at the challenges he will face, connected to his jealousy and ambition, setting the stage for a rich tapestry of adventure, magic, and moral dilemmas that will ensue as the brothers navigate their dangerous journey.
