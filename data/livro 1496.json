    "resumo": "\"Fiction Writers on Fiction Writing\" by Arthur Sullivant Hoffman is a comprehensive guidebook written in the early 20th century. This work compiles the insights and advice of over one hundred authors, sharing their personal methods, experiences, and thoughts on the craft of fiction writing. The focus is on the various approaches to storytelling, exploring themes such as character development, plot construction, and the writing process itself.   The opening of the book presents the author's rationale for its creation, which stems from a dissatisfaction with conventional writing instruction methods that prioritize formulaic approaches. Hoffman expresses his belief in the need for individuality in writing, arguing that successful writers have their unique processes rather than adhering strictly to universal rules. The initial portions also include a brief overview of the contributing authors and an introduction to the questionnaire that provides structured insight into how stories are born from different sparks such as characters, incidents, and situations. Through this framework, the book promises to delve into the diverse creative processes that underpin fiction writing, offering valuable lessons for both aspiring and established writers.
