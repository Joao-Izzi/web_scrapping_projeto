    "resumo": "\"Two-Legs\" by Carl Ewald is a fictional narrative likely written in the early 20th century. The story explores themes of civilization, nature, and the relationships between humans and animals through a tale that examines the lives of Two-Legs—a human couple—and how they interact with the animal kingdom. The opening introduces a diverse cast of animal characters who observe and react to the newcomers, establishing the foundation for a broader exploration of the concepts of dominance and survival in nature.  At the start of the tale, we are introduced to Two-Legs and his wife, who are unlike the other animals in their forest home. The animals express their curiosity and suspicion towards the humans, as they ponder the implications of Two-Legs' presence. The couple's kindness towards the injured dog earns them some initial acceptance, but as they navigate their new environment, the fear and protectiveness of the wild animals surface. The animals convene to discuss the threat posed by these strange creatures who walk on two legs and their potential to disrupt the balance of nature, setting the stage for conflicts and transformations in their world.
