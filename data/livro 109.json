    "resumo": "\"Trimblerigg: A Book of Revelation\" by Laurence Housman is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the character Jonathan Trimblerigg, whose journey of self-discovery is intertwined with themes of belief, morality, and the complexities of familial relationships within a religious context.   At the start of the novel, the narrator introduces us to Mr. Trimblerigg, a character shaped by the influences of family and faith. We learn that he possesses a clever yet complex nature, often engaging in self-serving actions that defy his supposed moral upbringing. The opening portions delve into Trimblerigg's childhood antics, including a misguided attempt to impress his family and peers that starkly sets the stage for his eventual calling to the ministry. His relationships with family members, especially with his sister Davidina and Uncle Phineas, reveal a competitive, morally ambiguous character navigating the expectations of his upbringing while grappling with his self-image and aspirations.
