    "resumo": "\"Wilson's Tales of the Borders and of Scotland, Volume 21\" by Wilson and Leighton is a collection of historical, traditional, and imaginative stories written during the late 19th century. This volume presents various tales rooted in Scottish folklore and history, drawing on the heritage of the Borders region. The stories blend fiction with cultural anecdotes, reflecting the lives and values of the people from Scotland, including elements of mystery and intrigue.  The opening portion introduces readers to a character named George Gourlay, a blacksmith living in the dark, cramped spaces of a Wynd in Edinburgh. He and his wife, Christian, discuss a mysterious, deserted flat that has been left untouched for two decades. Curiosity overcomes Gourlay, compelling him to explore the flat, where he encounters eerie sights that spark a journey filled with suspense, wonder, and the underlying theme of past transgressions. As Gourlay's adventure unfolds in the dark recesses of the house, secrets of its previous occupants begin to take shape, setting the tone for a tale steeped in rich storytelling and Scottish lore.
