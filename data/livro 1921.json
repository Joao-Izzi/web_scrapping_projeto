    "resumo": "\"Transcendentalism in New England: A History\" by Octavius Brooks Frothingham is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work explores the origins, development, and impact of the Transcendentalist movement, primarily focusing on its roots in German philosophy and its influence in New England. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ideas and key figures who shaped this intellectual current, highlighting its significance in American thought and culture.  At the start of the text, Frothingham sets the stage for a detailed examination of Transcendentalism by discussing important philosophical figures such as Immanuel Kant and the key concepts that underpin the movement. He notes the movement's historical context and purpose, stressing its role in shaping moral and social reform in America, particularly concerning issues like slavery and women's rights. By pointing out the blend of philosophy with practical reformist fervor, the beginning establishes a foundational understanding of the significance of Transcendentalism, both as a local phenomenon and as part of a broader intellectual tradition.
