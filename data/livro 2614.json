    "resumo": "\"The Enormous Room\" by E. E. Cummings is a novel written during the early 20th century, specifically amidst the backdrop of World War I. The narrative follows the experiences of a young American, Edward Estlin Cummings, as he navigates the challenges and absurdities faced while volunteering as an ambulance driver in France. The book explores themes of war, identity, and the clash of cultures, delving into Cummings' interactions with both American and French soldiers.  At the start of the novel, the protagonist recounts his time with the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps, illustrating the tensions between himself and his commanding officer, Mr. A. Following a series of misunderstandings and the sudden intrusion of a mysterious French officer, Cummings finds himself removed from his section, leading to a whirlwind journey that lands him in a prison cell under suspicion due to his friendship with another American, B. The opening portion introduces the bureaucratic chaos of wartime France, vividly depicting Cummingsâ€™ frustrations and his reflections on camaraderie, cultural differences, and the surreal reality of war, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of identity and the human spirit in the face of adversity.
