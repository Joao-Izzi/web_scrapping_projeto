    "resumo": "\"English Poems, Volume 01 (of 2) by Fernando Pessoa\" is a collection of poetry written in the early 20th century. The book features a variety of poetic forms and themes, with particular emphasis on love, loss, and the relationship between humanity and the divine. It includes the notable poem \"Antinous,\" which reflects on the sorrow and longing experienced by the Roman Emperor Hadrian following the death of his beloved Antinous, as well as a series of \"Inscriptions\" that present contemplative reflections on life and mortality.  The central poem, \"Antinous,\" depicts the profound grief of Emperor Hadrian over the death of the beautiful boy he loved and the sense of loss that permeates his existence. Hadrian's thoughts oscillate between memories of their love, the desire to immortalize Antinous through a statue, and reflections on the nature of beauty and divine favor. The poem captures a blend of erotic longing and philosophical pondering, as Hadrian wrestles with the permanence of death and the ephemeral nature of human experience. The subsequent section, \"Inscriptions,\" offers a series of meditations on existence, fading memories, and the passage of time, echoing themes of love and the transience of life. Together, these works create a deep and evocative exploration of love's complexities and the inevitability of loss. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
