    "resumo": "\"Elements of Military Art and Science\" by H. W. Halleck is a treatise on military strategy and tactics written in the mid-19th century. This instructional work encompasses various aspects of military operations including strategy, fortifications, tactics of battles, and the organization of different military branches such as infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The book aims to provide valuable insights for military officers, particularly those in volunteer and militia roles, drawing on historical examples and established military principles.  The opening of the text introduces the authorâ€™s rationale for writing a course on military art and science, emphasizing the long-standing pacific policies of the United States prior to the ongoing civil conflict. Halleck addresses the moral arguments against war, summarizing the views of various ethical writers, including Dr. Wayland, and provides justifications for the necessity of war in cases of self-defense and national security. This initial portion sets the tone for a serious exploration of military ethics and principles, establishing the groundwork for the following discussions on strategy and tactics that will unfold throughout the work.
