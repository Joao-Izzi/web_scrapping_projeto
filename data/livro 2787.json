    "resumo": "\"Royal Palaces and Parks of France\" by Francis Miltoun is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book examines the rich history and romantic incidents surrounding the royal parks and palaces of France, distancing itself from conventional guidebooks focused solely on political histories. Miltoun's exploration promises to reveal the unique character of French royal residences, emphasizing the interplay of sentiment and grandeur that distinguishes them from their counterparts in other nations.  The opening of the work sets the stage for an insightful journey through French history intertwined with its extraordinary royal architecture. Beginning with a reference to the nostalgia of a monk's pilgrimage, Miltoun reflects on how key events in French history unfolded not just in grand urban settings but also in magnificent country estates and their treed landscapes. He critiques the conventional ways of historical recounting, advocating for a narrative style that captures the vibrant and often exuberant life of courtly society, highlighting the passion for outdoor pursuits like hunting. The introductory chapter establishes a tone that invites readers to appreciate the historical and cultural significance embedded in both the palaces and their surrounding gardens, laying the groundwork for the itineraries and explorations to follow.
