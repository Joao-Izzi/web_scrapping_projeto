    "resumo": "\"Teatro Futurista Sintetico\" by F. T. Marinetti, Bruno Corra, and Emilio Settimelli is a theatrical manifesto written in the early 20th century. This work outlines the principles and ideologies of Futurism as they relate to theater, emphasizing brevity and dynamism in performances. The text critiques traditional theater for being overly long and static, and it advocates for a new synthetic approach that captures the fast-paced and fragmented nature of modern life, ultimately aiming to rejuvenate the art of theater.  The opening of \"Teatro Futurista Sintetico\" introduces the authorsâ€™ revolutionary vision for the stage, highlighting their desire to create a Futurist theater that is direct, energetic, and stripped of excessive dialogue and elaboration. The authors assert that most of the Italian populace prefers the theater over literature, thus affirming the necessity for a more engaging performance style. They declare their intention to fuse various elements and realities to create simultaneous scenes that reflect the chaotic essence of contemporary life. The initial scenes hinted at in the text showcase contrasting elements of bourgeois domesticity and the vibrant world outside, indicating a blend of narratives meant to provoke thought and emotion in the audience.
