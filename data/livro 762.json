    "resumo": "\"Dickens in Camp\" by Bret Harte is a poignant poem reflecting on the profound impact of Charles Dickens on American culture, written in the early 20th century. This literary work can be categorized as a tribute poem and is steeped in the sentiments of nostalgia as it blends the themes of appreciation and reverence for the literary master. The poem captures the spirit of the campfire gatherings of miners in California, illustrating how the art of storytelling serves to uplift the human spirit even amidst the hardships and struggles of life.  The poem unfolds a scene where a group of weary miners sits around a campfire under the moonlit sky, feeling the weight of their burdens from the relentless pursuit of wealth. One of the miners reads aloud from a beloved book by Dickens, particularly recalling the story of \"Little Nell.\" As the reading resonates, it evokes a sense of calm and introspection among the men, allowing them to momentarily escape their harsh realities. Meanwhile, it signifies the lasting legacy of Dickens and the universal themes of compassion and humanity in his work. The poem concludes with an image that intertwines the beauty of both the English countryside and the California wilderness, symbolizing the enduring connection between cultures through the shared love of literature.
