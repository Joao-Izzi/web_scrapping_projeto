    "resumo": "“A Struggle for a Fortune” by Harry Castlemon is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in a rural, post-Civil War Missouri and focuses on the lives of the impoverished Keeler family, particularly the troubled dynamic between Jonas Keeler, his wife, and the elderly Mr. Nickerson, who has lived with them under questionable circumstances since the war. The narrative explores themes of greed, family dynamics, and the impact of war on personal fortunes.  The opening of the novel introduces us to a grim scene in a small log cabin where the Keeler family is struggling with their finances in the aftermath of the Civil War. Jonas Keeler is frustrated over the rapid depletion of the money given to him by Mr. Nickerson, who, once a wealthy man, is now portrayed as a helpless figure living on the edge of sanity. An exchange between Jonas and his wife reveals their escalating tensions over finances and responsibilities. As Jonas grows increasingly resentful towards Mr. Nickerson, suspicion arises about hidden wealth, suggesting that Mr. Nickerson might still possess money that could change their fortunes. The emotional undercurrent sets the foundation for a complicated exploration of trust and betrayal as the story unfolds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
