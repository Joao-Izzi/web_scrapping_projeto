    "resumo": "\"Withered Leaves: A Novel, Vol. 2 (of 3)\" by Rudolf von Gottschall is a literary fiction work written in the late 19th century. The narrative unfolds around the complex emotional journeys of the main character, Blanden, who grapples with love, loss, and societal expectations, particularly concerning his relationship with a woman named Frau Salden. As their intertwined past and present struggles become more evident, themes of devotion, love, and the consequences of choices emerge prominently.  The opening of the novel introduces Blanden as a reflective and somewhat melancholic figure, who recalls his youthful dreams and feelings for nature, romance, and spirituality. His internal struggles become more pronounced when he encounters Frau Salden, the woman connected to his past affections, who has experienced her share of turmoil. The narrative swiftly shifts between reflections of Blandenâ€™s past, his longing for authentic connection, and the complications introduced by societal norms regarding love and sanctity. As he navigates the complexities of his feelings for both Frau Salden and her daughter Eva, the opening sets up a romantic tension infused with existential queries about faith, identity, and the sometimes burdensome weight of love.
