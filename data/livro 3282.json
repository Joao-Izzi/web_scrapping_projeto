    "resumo": "\"Casanovas Heimfahrt\" by Arthur Schnitzler is a novella written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Casanova, now in his fifties, as he experiences a deep longing to return to his hometown, Venice, after years of exile and adventurous living. The novella explores themes of nostalgia, aging, and the contrast between past desires and present realities.  At the start of the novella, Casanova reflects on his restless life and the emotional pain of exile, as he ponders his potential return to Venice. He has spent the last ten years in Mantua, grappling with his diminishing fortunes and the memory of his youthful escapades. As he prepares for the journey home, he encounters Olivo, a former acquaintance, who invites him to his home for a reunion with his wife, Amalia. The initial interactions hint at Casanova's past relationships and desires, particularly regarding Amalia and the intriguing new character of Marcolina, who captures his interest. This slice of the narrative hints at deeper explorations of Casanova's character as he navigates friendship, memory, and the hope for redemption in his waning years.
