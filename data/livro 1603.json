    "resumo": "\"The Man of Feeling\" by Henry Mackenzie is a novel written during the late 18th century, embodying the sentimental literature popular in its time. The narrative likely revolves around the character Harley, a man characterized by profound sensitivity and emotional depth, navigating the complexities of human feelings, social expectations, and interpersonal relationships.  The opening of the novel introduces us to an evocative scene in which the narrator, alongside a curate, finds a contemplative moment after a disappointing hunt. This setting leads to discussions about sentiment and the nature of emotions, particularly focusing on Harley, who is depicted as shy and bashful yet deeply compassionate. As the curate shares anecdotes involving Harley’s past — a peculiar man known for his abstract thoughts and the emotional impacts of experiences — we get a sense of Harley's gentle and introspective disposition. He is described as a person who often struggles with the expectations of society while maintaining a profound respect for virtue and righteousness, setting the tone for the exploration of emotion and morality that will permeate the novel.
