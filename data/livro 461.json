    "resumo": "\"The Associate Hermits\" by Frank R. Stockton is a novel written in the late 19th century. The book centers around the Archibald family, particularly Mr. Hector Archibald and his wife, as they navigate the unusual decision to take a wedding journey that they plan to undertake—unless anything sabotages their plans—without their daughter’s new husband. This unique premise sets the stage for humorous situations and social commentary about customs and individual aspirations.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, who are excited about their daughter's wedding but at odds over the tradition of a wedding trip. Their daughter, Kate, along with her fiancé, desires to stay home instead of embarking on a honeymoon, leading to the unconventional plan where the Archibalds will take a trip while the newlyweds enjoy their home. The amusing exchanges reveal the contrasting personalities between Hector, the adventurous, free-spirited father, and his more traditional wife, Harriet. As the plan unfolds, they decide on a camp in the woods, bringing their delightful friend Margery along for company, setting up a mix of comedic drama and potential adventures to come in their new surroundings.
