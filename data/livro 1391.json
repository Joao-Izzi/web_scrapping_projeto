    "resumo": "\"Manifesto dos Estudantes da Universidade de Coimbra á opinião illustrada do…\" by Anthero de Quental is a significant historical document produced during the early 1860s, a period of social and political transformation in Portugal. This book is essentially a treatise that articulates the grievances of the student body at the University of Coimbra against the existing authority and legislation, particularly targeting the university's reitor, the Viscount of São Jeronimo. It serves as a manifesto of protest driven by a call for justice, reform, and recognition of the rights and dignity of students in the context of an oppressive educational system reflective of outdated political norms.  The content of the manifesto focuses on a specific incident on December 8, 1862, when students evacuated a ceremonial hall in protest against their reitor. Quental articulates their demands for a more equitable and just legal system, challenging the severe measures imposed by the administration, which were likened to remnants of an oppressive past. The students emphasize their intent to stand firmly against unjust authority, demand reforms to outdated legislation, and advocate for the rights of the individual against systemic oppression. They assert their voices as representatives of a new generation seeking to reclaim their dignity and freedom in a regenerating Portugal, framing their protest as a noble pursuit rooted in the ideals of justice and progress.
