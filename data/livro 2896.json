    "resumo": "\"Reply of the Philadelphia Brigade Association to the Foolish and Absurdâ€¦\" is a historical account published by The Philadelphia Brigade Association in the early 20th century. This document serves as a formal rebuttal to the narratives penned by Lieutenant Frank A. Haskell, a soldier in the 6th Wisconsin Infantry, regarding the Battle of Gettysburg. It critically examines Haskell's claims, suggesting that they misrepresent the actions and bravery of the Philadelphia Brigade and other regiments involved in this pivotal Civil War battle.  The content predominantly focuses on disproving Haskell's assertions, which the Philadelphia Brigade Association deems as exaggerated and derogatory. The text details significant moments from the battle and emphasizes the courage and sacrifice of the soldiers of the Philadelphia Brigade, who suffered substantial casualties while successfully repelling the Confederate assault led by Pickett's division. The document juxtaposes Haskell's narrative with official accounts and testimonies from officers present during the battle, aiming to vindicate the reputation of the brigade and its leadership while simultaneously critiquing the errors in Haskell's retrospective depiction of events, portraying it as a combination of egotism and distortion of the truth.
