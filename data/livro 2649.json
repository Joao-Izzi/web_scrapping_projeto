    "resumo": "\"The Life and Letters of Walter H. Page, Volume II\" by Burton Jesse Hendrick is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the life of Walter H. Page, particularly focusing on his experiences as the American Ambassador in London during World War I. The volume captures significant events, such as the sinking of the Lusitania and its aftermath, illustrating the political and social climate of the time.  The opening of the volume conveys the shock and gravity surrounding the news of the Lusitania disaster, which profoundly affected the American Embassy in London. Page, exhibiting a stoic demeanor, receives updates on the tragic loss of life, including American citizens. As he struggles with the implications for U.S. foreign policy, the narrative highlights the somber atmosphere at the Embassy during a dinner in honor of Colonel House, marked by a sense of disbelief and heavy contemplation about the United States' potential entry into the war. Page's internal conflicts and his relationships with key figures, including President Wilson and Colonel House, are woven throughout, setting the stage for a deeper examination of his diplomatic challenges and views on American policies during the war.
