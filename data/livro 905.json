    "resumo": "\"De moedige vrouw\" by Ellen Key is a philosophical work addressing women's rights and personal development written in the late 19th century. The book examines the societal norms surrounding womanhood, challenging the notion of traditional femininity and advocating for personal freedom and self-realization for women. Key emphasizes the importance of courage and individualism as a pathway toward a more authentic and fulfilling life for women.  At the start of the book, the author delves into the concept of conventional femininity, critiquing societal norms that demand women to prioritize appearance and conformity over genuine self-expression. Key argues that this leads to a superficial understanding of womanhood and stifles true individuality. She highlights the ongoing struggle for women to assert their personal rights and freedoms against the pressures of historical customs and societal expectations, setting the stage for a discourse on self-development and the emerging ideals for women in contemporary society. Through her exploration of past and present views on womanhood, Key invites the reader to consider what it truly means to embrace one's personal freedom and identity.
