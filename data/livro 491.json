    "resumo": "\"Tartuffe; Or, The Hypocrite\" by Molière is a classic comedic play written in the mid-17th century. The work explores themes of hypocrisy, religious devotion, and familial conflict through the character of Orgon, who has become infatuated with Tartuffe, a conman posing as a pious man. The play serves as a satirical commentary on society's susceptibility to deceit and the dangers of blind faith.  At the start of \"Tartuffe,\" we are introduced to Madame Pernelle, who criticizes her family and household for their lack of respect and adherence to the religious dictate she supports through Tartuffe. Orgon, her son, idolizes Tartuffe and disregards the concerns of his family, including his daughter Mariane, who is secretly in love with Valère. As the scene unfolds, the family's growing frustration with Tartuffe's influence highlights the tension between genuine devotion and the false piety that deceives Orgon, setting the stage for the comedic conflicts that will ensue as they attempt to confront his misguided affections.
