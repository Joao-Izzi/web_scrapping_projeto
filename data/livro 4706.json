    "resumo": "\"Een feudale familie in Egypte\" by E. Amélineau is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work explores the lives of the Botros family, also known as the Battarsi, who have established themselves in Egypt’s Upper Nile region, chronicling their wealth, lifestyle, and the social structure surrounding them. The narrative is set against a backdrop of rural Egyptian life, encompassing both the family dynamics and the socio-political environment of that era.  The beginning of the book introduces the Botros family and their stronghold in the village of Sjeikh-Marzoek, detailing their agricultural riches and lifestyle. The narrator recounts his journey to visit the family, painting a vivid picture of the Egyptian countryside, the vibrant village life, and the contrasts between the wealthy Botros and the local fellahs (peasants). Central character Abd el Sjahid Botros, the family’s leading representative, is portrayed as a significant figure, engaging with the community and maintaining a complex relationship with the local populace, which foreshadows both personal and familial challenges they face in the changing socio-political landscape.
