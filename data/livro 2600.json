    "resumo": "\"Sämmtliche Werke 5: Dramatische Werke\" by Nikolai Vasilevich Gogol is a collection of dramatic works written in the early 19th century. This volume includes the famous comedy \"Der Revisor\" (\"The Government Inspector\"), which explores themes of bureaucracy, corruption, and human folly. The story revolves around a government inspector who is mistaken for an important official, leading to a series of comical and absurd situations among the local officials of a small Russian town.  The opening portion of \"Der Revisor\" sets the stage in a provincial city, where the local police chief and various officials are in a state of panic over the unexpected arrival of an inspector from Petersburg. Antón Antónowitsch Skwósnik-Dmuchánowski, the police chief, gathers his subordinates to discuss the potential consequences of this visit. They worry about their own misdeeds being discovered and scramble to cover up their incompetence and corruption, believing that the inspector is already among them, incognito. As tension builds among the officials, the audience is introduced to their bumbling personalities and schemes, foreshadowing the chaos that will ensue. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
