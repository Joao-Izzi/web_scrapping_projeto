    "resumo": "\"Mitteilungen Band XI, Heft 4-6\" by Landesverein Sächsischer Heimatschutz is a collection of periodical reports focused on heritage preservation, written in the early 20th century. The publication contains various articles relating to local history, cultural thought, and specific heritage projects, reflecting the organization's efforts to promote and protect regional culture and monuments in Saxony.  The opening of this volume includes an introduction discussing the challenges faced by the Landesverein Sächsischer Heimatschutz due to rising printing costs post-World War I, which are critically impacting their ability to continue publishing. It details the financial struggles of the organization and the need for additional support from its members to preserve the heritage of Saxony. Following this introduction, the section hints at a broader exploration of specific cultural and historical subjects, such as postal milestones from the 18th century and heritage reflections in the works of Swiss author Gottfried Keller, thus setting the stage for a deeper engagement with regional cultural preservation within the publication.
