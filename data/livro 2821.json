    "resumo": "\"The Night Horseman\" by Max Brand is a novel written in the early 20th century, around 1920. The story revolves around Randall Byrne, a highly educated and introspective doctor who finds himself navigating the rugged life of the American frontier. As he grapples with unusual challenges related to his patient, old Joe Cumberland, the narrative introduces themes of love, loss, and the complexities of human connection through the interactions of Byrne, Kate Cumberland, and the enigmatic figure known as Whistling Dan.  The opening of \"The Night Horseman\" introduces us to Randall Byrne, a brilliant but frail doctor who is characterized by his profound intellect and lack of practical experience in the rugged realities of frontier life. As he settles into the town of Elkhead, he receives an urgent call from Kate Cumberland, whose father is gravely ill. The doctor's initial reluctance vanishes as he senses the gravity of the situation and the emotional weight tied to it. Following Kate into the wilderness, Byrne becomes embroiled in the enigmatic circumstances surrounding old Joe's decline, marked by a strange connection to a mysterious man named Whistling Dan, a figure wrapped in local legend and suspense. The stage is set for a gripping tale of psychological tension, interspersed with the stark beauty and harsh realities of life on the frontier. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
