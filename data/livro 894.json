    "resumo": "\"Tibetan Grammar\" by H. A. Jäschke is a linguistic guidebook written in the late 19th century. This work focuses on the grammatical structure of the Tibetan language, covering various aspects from phonology to syntax and etymology. As the first comprehensive grammar of Tibetan, it serves as an essential resource for those studying the language, particularly emphasizing dialects and specific regional variations.  At the start of the grammar, the author discusses the context and purpose of the second edition, noting the contributions of Dr. H. Wenzel who prepared this edition. The preface elaborates on the evolution of the text from its lithographed first edition and outlines the various sections included in the grammar. It then explains some technical details about the Tibetan scripts, pronunciation rules, and the structure of the language. The opening also reflects on the collaboration between Jäschke and Wenzel and mentions the importance of regional dialects, particularly in Western Tibet, indicating a focus on practical application for English speakers in India.
