    "resumo": "\"Australia—Fortune Land\" by Roderick O'Hargan is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the profound impact of the gold rush on Australian society, detailing the journey of Edward Hargraves and the drastic changes brought about by the discovery of gold in the continent. It is primarily focused on the gold rush era and the societal upheaval it caused.  The narrative begins with Hargraves leaving California, where he previously sought fortune during the 1849 gold rush, and returning to Australia with an ambition to find a more prosperous goldfield. After much skepticism, his initial discovery leads to widespread excitement and a rush of miners pouring into previously quiet towns, driven by dreams of wealth. The book illustrates the chaotic societal changes as people abandoned their regular jobs, the disruption of order, and the emergence of new social dynamics, where fortunes were made and lost almost overnight. As Hargraves and other discoverers achieved fame and wealth, the story also highlights the mix of fortune hunters, adventurers, and opportunists navigating this transformative period in Australian history.
