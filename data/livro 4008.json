    "resumo": "\"Tom Akerley\" by Theodore Goodridge Roberts is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the protagonist, Tom Akerley, who is an officer in the Royal Air Force experiencing turmoil after striking a superior officer. Seeking refuge in the remote woods, he finds himself on the run and embroiled in a peculiar situation involving a hermit named Gaspard and his strong-willed granddaughter, Catherine.  The opening of the narrative introduces Akerley in the midst of a crisis, having fled after confronting Colonel Nasher over a fallen comrade. He crashes his airplane and ends up at Gaspard's homestead, where he finds an empty yet inviting space and the mystery surrounding the inhabitants. As Akerley begins to navigate life in the wilderness, he contemplates the peculiar claims of Gaspard, who believes he encountered a devilâ€”Akerley himself. The story unfolds into a blend of adventure and human complexities as Akerley integrates himself into the quiet rural life while dealing with the circumstances of his past, including the repercussions of his previous actions.
