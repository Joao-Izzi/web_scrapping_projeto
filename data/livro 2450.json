    "resumo": "\"Marie és más asszonyok\" by Lajos Biró is a collection of novellas written in the early 20th century. The work explores the lives and interactions of various characters in Paris, particularly focusing on their relationships, aspirations, and disappointments. The story prominently features a young protagonist who becomes enchanted with the romantic notions of Paris and experiences a series of personal revelations and encounters with women such as Marie and other residents of the Bodouin hotel.  The opening of the novel introduces the protagonist as he arrives at a quaint hotel in Paris, recommended by friends. He is greeted by Monsieur Bodouin, the hotel owner, and his family, including a housemaid named Marie, who captures his interest due to her seemingly charming name. However, he is soon met with disappointment as Marie turns out to be a middle-aged woman instead of the enchanting Parisian woman he imagined. This sets the tone for the rest of the story, as the protagonist navigates through a mix of disillusionment and camaraderie with the hotel's inhabitants, ultimately unraveling the nuances of their lives and the significance of Marie herself. The narrative hints at themes of unfulfilled dreams and the complexities of human relationships. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
