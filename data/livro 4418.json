    "resumo": "\"The Bat\" by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood is a mystery novel written during the early 20th century. The book hinges on the enigmatic figure of the Bat, a master criminal eluding capture through audacious and cunning heists, and delves into the chaotic atmosphere of fear that surrounds his exploits. Central to the narrative are characters such as the intrepid Miss Cornelia Van Gorder, a spirited aged spinster longing for adventure, and the determined detective Anderson, who seeks to confront the criminal mastermind.  The opening of \"The Bat\" sets the stage for a gripping tale of tension and intrigue. It begins with the desperate attempts of law enforcement and private detectives to apprehend the Bat, whose dark and elusive nature has captivated the public imagination. As police and journalists alike grow increasingly frantic over his brazen crimes, a sense of urgency permeates the narrative. Meanwhile, Miss Cornelia, having moved into a newly rented country house, finds herself unwittingly drawn into the Bat’s dangerous territory, escalating the stakes. The scene is further complicated by elements of superstition and local fears, especially as employees begin to leave out of fear for their safety. The imminent storm adds to the suspense, establishing an atmosphere ripe for confrontations, both between characters and with the looming threat of the Bat himself.
