    "resumo": "\"A List of Philippine Baptismal Names\" by Schneider, Barrows, and Christie is a reference publication produced in the early 20th century. This book serves as a comprehensive catalog of baptismal names commonly found in the Philippines, primarily collected from Roman Catholic calendars, school registers, and other records. It was likely compiled in response to the challenges faced by American educators in accurately spelling and understanding Filipino names in a time when the proper use of names was becoming increasingly relevant in the educational system.  The book consists of a list of over 1,400 names with annotations about common spelling errors, pronunciation tips, and historical context. It was compiled by E.E. Schneider and revised by Emerson Christie, who meticulously cross-referenced numerous sources to standardize the spelling. The text is not only intended for educators but also serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the cultural and linguistic heritage of the Philippines, showcasing the blend of influences these names carry and providing insights into naming conventions within Filipino communities.
