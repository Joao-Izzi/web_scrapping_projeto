    "resumo": "\"Without Dogma: A Novel of Modern Poland\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story follows the introspective journey of Leon Ploszowski, a man plagued by existential doubts and disillusionment, as he navigates the complexities of love, particularly his feelings for Aniela, a woman caught between her own societal expectations and personal desires. The novel explores themes of identity, cultural heritage, and the conflict between personal ambitions and social obligations.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Leon, who reflects on his upbringing in a wealthy family and his father's tragic past, marked by the death of his mother. Set in Rome, Leon decides to keep a diary as a means of self-exploration following a conversation with a friend about the value of sincere memoirs for future generations. Through his introspective thoughts, we learn about his sensitive nature, his complex feelings towards art and society, his lack of direction in life, and his awareness of his own \"improductivit√©.\" As he prepares to return to Warsaw, he acknowledges his aunt's intentions of marrying him off, while he is simultaneously entangled in nascent feelings for Aniela, creating an intriguing tension that suggests further emotional and narrative developments.
