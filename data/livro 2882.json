    "resumo": "\"Report on the Migration of Birds in the Spring and Autumn of 1881. Third Report\" by Mr. John A. Harvie Brown and others is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work details the findings from a committee formed to investigate bird migration patterns observed at lighthouses and lightships. It likely focuses on the migration behavior of various bird species across the coasts of Scotland and England, providing valuable insights into their seasonal movements.  At the start of the report, the authors describe the rationale behind their investigations, emphasizing the need for continuous and systematic documentation of bird migrations. They outline that this report is based on observations collected by various lighthouse keepers and volunteers, tasked with tracking the movements of birds during specific periods in spring and autumn. The report begins with detailed accounts from the East Coast of Scotland, citing specific bird sightings, their numbers, and the associated weather conditions, establishing a foundation for understanding the migratory routes and patterns over time.
