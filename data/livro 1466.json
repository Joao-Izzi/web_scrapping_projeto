    "resumo": "\"Kaarle XII: Viisikuvaelmainen näytelmä\" by August Strindberg is a dramatic play written in the early 20th century. The play centers around the tumultuous period of Sweden's King Charles XII, exploring the political and personal dynamics of his reign during a time of crisis. The narrative is steeped in historical context, portraying key figures such as the king, Ulrika Eleonora, and Görtz, set against a backdrop of war and national upheaval.  The opening of the play introduces a desolate coastal setting, where a solitary man reminisces about his lost home and family, symbolizing the devastation wrought by war and disease. As he interacts with a coastal guard, the dialogue reveals a shared sense of despair and longing for a past that now seems irretrievable. This somber scene sets the stage for the tension between loyalty to the monarchy and the political machinations surrounding Charles XII, as various other characters—politicians, soldiers, and common folk—prepare for the king's arrival amidst whispers of betrayal and conflict. The initial discussion foreshadows the deep political intrigue that will unfold as the story progresses. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
