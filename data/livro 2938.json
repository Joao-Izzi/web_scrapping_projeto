    "resumo": "\"The Ground Plan of the English Parish Church\" by A. Hamilton Thompson is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work focuses on the architectural development of parish churches in England, highlighting how their ground plans evolved from earlier forms and influenced medieval architecture. It seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various styles and modifications that characterized parish churches throughout different periods.  The opening of the book introduces the authorâ€™s intent to fill a gap in existing literature by examining the development of the ground plan for parish churches in England. Thompson notes the limited accessibility of related materials for general students and establishes that his focus will be solely on ground plans and their historical evolution, excluding discussions on elevations or decorative features. He highlights several influential types of church plans, including the basilican church, while acknowledging the unique adaptations made in England. The preface sets the stage for a detailed exploration of these architectural developments throughout the subsequent chapters. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
