    "resumo": "\"Ireland under the Tudors, with a Succinct Account of the Earlier History. Vol. I.\" by Richard Bagwell is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the complex and often tumultuous relationship between England and Ireland during the Tudor period, spanning the reigns of Henry VIII and his successors. Through a detailed examination of Irish history leading up to and during the Tudor era, it delves into the socio-political landscape and the impact of both English governance and indigenous responses.  At the start of this volume, the author outlines the purpose and scope of his work, emphasizing the need for an impartial historical account that goes beyond simply affirming existing biases. He introduces significant themes such as the tribal and Celtic structures of pre-Tudor Ireland and begins to trace the historical elements leading to the English involvement in Ireland. Particular attention is given to the early governance dynamics, the effects of internal strife, and the impact of England's changing political landscape on Irish affairs. Bagwell suggests that understanding the historical context is essential for grasping the complexities of Irish identity and governance during the subsequent centuries.
