    "resumo": "\"Nurmeksen kapina: Historiallinen kertomus Itä-Suomesta\" by Johan Albert Bergman is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story examines the Nurmes uprising in 1710, triggered by the oppressive tax collector Affleck and the resultant unrest among the peasants in Eastern Finland. The narrative is likely to explore themes of national identity, rebellion against oppression, and personal relationships amid social upheaval.  The opening portion of the novel introduces us to Jaakko Nevalainen, an elderly blacksmith who passionately supports his homeland during the tumultuous events of war. As he worries over the absence of his soldier-son, Jaakko's conversations with young Juhana, a relative staying with him, reflect the growing tension of the times. Meanwhile, the narrative establishes the looming threat of oppression from the tax collector Affleck, leading to discussions of rebellion among the local populace. This sets the stage for the conflicts that will shape the lives of the characters, rooted in both historical context and personal drama. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
