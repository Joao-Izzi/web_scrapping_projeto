This publication features a range of subjects, combining articles on contemporary issues, scientific discussions, and artistic showcases. The main themes in this issue include an examination of environmental concerns regarding deforestation in France and its impacts on agriculture, as well as commentary on social issues like crime in Paris.   The opening of this edition establishes the gravity of forest depletion in France, discussing its consequences on the climate, agriculture, and local economies. It describes how unchecked deforestation has exacerbated flooding issues, particularly in the Hautes-Alpes region, leading to widespread agricultural decline. Additionally, it highlights a contemporary focus on proposed solutions to manage torrents and suggests that reforestation could play a critical role in mitigating these environmental disasters.
