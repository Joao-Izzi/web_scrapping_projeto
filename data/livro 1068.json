    "resumo": "\"The Power of Mesmerism\" by Anonymous is a highly erotic narrative written during the late 19th century. This Victorian novel delves into themes of lust and desire, centered around the Etheridge family, particularly focusing on the complex and taboo relationships between the family members, including brother-sister dynamics. The book's introduction sets the stage for a provocative exploration of sensuality, utilizing the concept of mesmerism to heighten the erotic experiences of the characters.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Brackley Hall and the Etheridge family, including Mr. and Mrs. Etheridge and their two children, Frank and Ethel. As they eagerly await Frank's return from Germany, a charged atmosphere of sexual tension develops, particularly between Frank and Ethel, who exhibit a burgeoning interest in each other. The opening portion highlights their growing desires through dream-like states influenced by mesmerism, leading to increasingly explicit encounters. The hypnotic undertones set a surreal mood as boundaries between familial affection and erotic desire blur, foreshadowing the intense and controversial interactions that follow.
