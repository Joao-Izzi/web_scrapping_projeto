At the start of the diary, Pepys reflects on his health and domestic life at the end of the previous year, expressing hopes for his wife's pregnancy, which ultimately does not come to fruition. He outlines the political climate in England, noting the disturbances within the Rump Parliament and the turbulence of military leaders such as Lord Lambert and Sir John Lawson.
