    "resumo": "\"Eversti Chabert\" by Honoré de Balzac is a novel written in the early 19th century. This work resonates with themes of identity, social status, and personal struggle as it follows the tragic story of Colonel Chabert, a man who is believed to have died in battle but instead returns to find his life has drastically changed. The narrative explores Chabert's quest for recognition and justice, underscored by the societal indifference and scorn he faces.  At the start of the story, readers are introduced to an unnamed old soldier, later revealed to be Colonel Chabert, who struggles to make himself heard amidst the bustling atmosphere of a law office in Paris. The tone is one of frustration and despair as the old colonel attempts to speak with the lawyer Derville about his plight, only to be overlooked and mocked by the younger clerks in the office. Despite the indifference shown to him, Chabert remains steadfast in his need to confront the reality of his situation, as he feels lost and abandoned, battling against the perceptions and assumptions of those around him. The opening effectively sets the stage for a poignant exploration of loss, identity, and the quest for dignity in a dismissive society. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
