    "resumo": "\"Les mains pleines de roses, pleines d'or et pleines de sang\" by Arsène Houssaye is a novel written during the late 19th century. The story is centered around the life of Georges du Quesnoy, a young man transitioning into adulthood as he navigates the complexities of love, ambition, and societal expectations. The narrative is imbued with a mix of romance and philosophical reflections, hinting at deeper themes of fate and the consequences of one's actions.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the idyllic setting of the Soissonnais region, where Georges rides through a picturesque landscape, filled with vibrant nature. His peaceful ride is interrupted by an enchanting vision of a young woman in a white dress, which captivates him deeply. As he becomes increasingly fascinated by this mysterious figure, he learns that the château of Margival, where she appears to reside, is only occupied by her and her father. This chance encounter sets the stage for a budding romance and explores themes of youthful idealism as Georges expresses his desire for experiences beyond the sheltered life he has lead thus far. The initial chapters skillfully weave together elements of fate and personal desire, laying the groundwork for the emotional and existential dilemmas that await Georges in his quest for love and identity.
