    "resumo": "\"The Devil is an Ass\" by Ben Jonson is a satirical comedy written in the early 17th century. The play explores themes of vice and folly within Jacobean society through the character Pug, a devilish figure sent to earth, and Fitzdottrel, a foolish gentleman entangled in deceptions and schemes. Jonsonâ€™s blend of humor and social critique offers insights into the human condition while reflecting the societal concerns of his time.  The opening of the play introduces the character Pug, who is eager to prove his worth as a devil on a mission to corrupt people on earth. Meanwhile, Fitzdottrel, who is portrayed as an overreaching and gullible man, becomes embroiled in plots that showcase his naivety and the ludicrous nature of his aspirations. The initial scenes set up a contrast between the supernatural and the foolishness of human behavior, establishing a comic tone while hinting at deeper satirical commentary on the vices and follies of Jonson's contemporary society.
