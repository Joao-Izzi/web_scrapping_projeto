    "resumo": "\"Engelbrekt Engelbrektinpoika II\" by C. Georg Starbäck is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. This narrative focuses on the character Engelbrekt, a nobleman caught in the socio-political turmoil of 15th-century Sweden, as tensions between the ruling class and the common folk escalate. The story begins with themes of oppression, rebellion, and the looming conflicts that engage various factions, setting the stage for the unfolding drama.  The opening of the novel presents a spring season that starkly contrasts with the despair felt by the Swedish populace under foreign rulers. The text begins with a description of nature awakening while the country is plagued by an oppressive atmosphere and a sense of impending doom, as the nobility continue their merciless rule. The character Jösse Eerikinpoika, the governor, is seen plotting against Engelbrekt as he prepares for what appears to be a significant confrontation. Meanwhile, crucial discussions take place among prominent figures about the approach to take against the rebellious forces led by Engelbrekt. This introduction effectively establishes a tense backdrop of political intrigue, with unexpected visitors, ominous prophecies, and plans for conflict threading through the narrative.
