    "resumo": "\"In the Days of Queen Mary\" by E. E. Crake is a historical novel likely written in the late 19th century. It delves into the turbulent period of Queen Mary's reign in England, focusing on the lives of the Jefferay family, particularly the twin brothers William and Ralph, and their sister Susan. The narrative explores themes of loyalty and resilience amid political upheaval, with the brothers finding themselves entangled in conflicts surrounding the monarchy and religious persecution.  The opening portion of the novel sets the stage at Chiddingly Place, introducing us to the idyllic life of the Jefferay family. As the twins enjoy a sunny Midsummer Day, their peace is contrasted with the foreboding political landscape, where their uncle, Sir John Jefferay, discusses the dangers of court intrigues and the impending threat of the Marian Persecution. The story hints at the twins' remarkable resemblance and how this will play a significant role in the unfolding drama, especially as they navigate their connections to the court and the external dangers posed by political factions. As events unfold, tensions rise, and the narrative promises an engaging mix of familial bonds and the historical challenges of the era. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
