    "resumo": "\"The Fairy Godmother-in-law\" by Oliver Herford is a whimsical collection of humorous poems and fairy tales likely written in the early 20th century. This playful work reimagines traditional fairy tale motifs, particularly focusing on the experiences and challenges faced by Cinderella after her marriage to Prince Charming and the unexpected complications introduced by her fairy godmother-in-law. The book offers a satirical take on familial relationships and societal norms, wrapped in enchanting rhymes and delightful illustrations by the author.  In this collection, each poem contributes to a larger narrative that explores themes of love, responsibility, and the absurdity of royal life. Cinderella, initially thought to be living happily ever after, grapples with the reality of her fairy godmother's meddling ways, which lead to humorous predicaments involving the prince and other royal figures. For instance, the fairy godmother-in-law's antics include transforming meals, altering wardrobes, and playfully disrupting the royal couple's life. The stories take on a humorous tone that blends traditional fairy tale elements with a modern sensibility, ultimately inviting readers to see the lighter side of love, duty, and magical mischief.
