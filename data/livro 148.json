    "resumo": "\"Brother Against Brother; or, The Tompkins Mystery\" by John R. Musick is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set during the tumultuous period leading to the American Civil War, exploring themes of morality, conflict, and family ties. The main character, George W. Tompkins, is a Virginia planter torn between the institution of slavery he benefits from and the moral implications that haunt him, while also dealing with the violent legacy of his family's recent tragedy.  The beginning of the novel sets the stage with a vivid description of a stagecoach ride through the misty Virginia countryside, introducing a somber and contemplative George W. Tompkins. Outwardly composed, he is burdened by memories of recent family tragedies, hinting at a deepening mystery surrounding his brother's family who were brutally murdered, supposedly connected to the slaves on their plantation. As the narrative unfolds, Tompkins engages in a heated discussion on the morality of slavery with a fellow traveler, and later, a chance encounter with a disturbed boy named Crazy Joe introduces further complexity to the plot. Through these initial chapters, Musick weaves a tapestry of personal and social dilemmas, foreshadowing the coming conflict over slavery that would tear families and the nation apart.
