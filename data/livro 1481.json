    "resumo": "\"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves\" is a historical account produced through the Federal Writers' Project between the late 1930s. The work features firsthand accounts from former slaves, providing their perspectives and experiences during slavery and the years following emancipation. This collection serves to capture the voices of individuals who lived through one of the most harrowing periods in American history.  The opening of this narrative presents a series of interviews with various former slaves, each sharing their life stories with vivid detail and personal reflections. For instance, Harriet Eddington recounts her origins and childhood, while Mary Edwards reminisces about her kind master and the relative freedom of her days after the war. These voices not only shed light on the daily struggles and traditions of enslaved people but also reflect their resilience, sense of community, and the lingering effects of slavery in the post-war era. The narratives, interspersed with personal anecdotes and cultural traditions, create a rich tapestry that reflects a unique historical period through the eyes of those who lived it.
