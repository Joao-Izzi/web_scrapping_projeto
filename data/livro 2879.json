    "resumo": "\"Warrior-Maid of Mars\" by Alfred Coppel is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century, specifically in the early 1950s. The story navigates themes of survival, honor, and transformation in a dying world on the planet Laurr, which struggles with invasions and internal conflict. Coppel weaves a tale that combines elements of adventure and romance against a backdrop of an alien society facing ecological disaster.  The plot centers around Telis of Lars, a young warrior and captain-general of Laurr's armies, who is chosen by the clandestine society, the Maldia, to lead an attack against the Tellurians, a group of alien scientists visiting Laurr. Amidst a battle for power and survival, Telis finds himself thwarted by his childhood friend Gorla, who is part of the Priesthood, and caught in a web of political intrigue, personal honor, and the troubling allure of the Tellurians. As the story unfolds, Telis grapples with his prejudices against the Tellurians, particularly when he meets Leslie Karr, a Tellurian woman with whom he forms a complicated relationship. The narrative crescendos into a climactic confrontation that challenges the very essence of Telis' values, raising questions about friendship, loyalty, and the potential for redemption, both for individuals and their world.
