    "resumo": "\"Amica America\" by Jean Giraudoux is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story likely explores themes of travel, culture, and the intersection of French and American identities amidst the backdrop of war. As the title suggests, it appears to be a personal journey or travelogue, possibly featuring a central character navigating experiences in America.  At the start of the novel, the narrator embarks on a steamer journey from France to America, marveling at the scenery and the passengers on board. There is a mix of reflections on the beauty of nature and the emotions of those traveling, including a woman mourning the absence of children on their voyage. Among the company is a companion named Bord√©ras, who engages in philosophical conversations with the narrator, forming a connection that seems to represent deeper themes of existence and camaraderie amid the uncertainties brought by the onset of war. The opening sets a contemplative tone, hinting at the narrator's introspection and exploration of cultural differences as they approach their destination.
