    "resumo": "\"A Report of Major Hart's Case, of Rice-Frauds, near Seringapatam\" by W. H. Inglis is a historical account written in the early 19th century. This report investigates allegations of fraud related to rice supplies during military operations in India, particularly focusing on the conduct of Major Hart. The book presents details surrounding the administrative and logistical challenges faced by military personnel in colonial India, as well as the implications of possible misconduct.  The content of the book unfolds as a detailed examination of Major Hart's alleged involvement in fraudulent rice transactions, juxtaposed with testimonies from various military officers and stakeholders. Inglis scrutinizes correspondence and reports from military superiors, including Major-General Macaulay, highlighting inconsistencies and defenses made by both Hart and others involved in the grain supply chain. The narrative reveals the complexities of military supply management at the time and the subsequent repercussions on Hart's reputation and career, ultimately calling for a reconsideration of the judgment against him amidst claims of systemic corruption in the procurement and distribution of provisions for the army.
