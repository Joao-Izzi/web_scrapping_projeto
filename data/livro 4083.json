    "resumo": "\"Hidden Gold\" by Wilder Anthony is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds in the rugged backdrop of Wyoming, centering around rancher Gordon Wade as he grapples with the incursion of sheep onto his cattle range, which threatens his livelihood. The narrative explores themes of territorial conflict, loyalty, and budding romance amidst the tension between cattlemen and sheep herders, with a particular focus on Wade's difficult relationship with Race Moran, a man with obscure motives.  At the start of the novel, Gordon Wade observes an overwhelming influx of sheep in his valley, signaling an imminent threat to his cattle ranch. The tension mounts as he informs his foreman, Bill Santry, of the situation, and they debate how to handle the abrasive sheep herders, particularly Oscar Jensen, who seems to be backed by the underhanded agent, Race Moran. As Wade seeks to maintain peace, the opening scenes deftly illustrate his character's sense of responsibility and inner turmoil. The conflict quickly escalates when he learns of a murder in the sheep camp, thrusting him into a maelstrom of violence and forcing him to confront not only the threat to his ranch but also his complex feelings for a local girl named Dorothy Purnell, all while struggling against the backdrop of political and ethical dilemmas that arise from the clashes between ranchers and their sheep-laden adversaries.
