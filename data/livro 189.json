    "resumo": "\"The Disowned — Volume 04\" by Baron Edward Bulwer Lytton is a novel written during the mid-19th century. The narrative follows the struggles of Clarence, a young man grappling with the complexities of identity, familial rejection, and societal expectations. As he navigates through a world of high society, love interests, and personal conflicts, the story explores themes of honor, ambition, and the pursuit of one's true self against the backdrop of social intrigue.  At the start of the novel, Clarence is in a state of emotional turmoil after being rejected by his father and relating to his benefactor, Talbot, who encourages him to embrace his true identity. Yet, Clarence's sense of worth is challenged as he confronts the elitist snobbery of figures like Lord Borodaile, who looks down upon him. The opening chapters introduce key characters such as Talbot, who provides emotional support, and La Meronville, whose romantic entanglements further complicate Clarence's social standing. As tensions rise, especially following a confrontation between Clarence and Borodaile that leads to a duel over honor, readers are drawn into a web of interpersonal conflicts that promise to unfold throughout the rest of the story.
