    "resumo": "\"Has Anyone Here Seen Kelly?\" by Bryce Walton is a science fiction story written during the mid-20th century. The narrative follows the character Kelly, who grapples with the impact of prolonged space travel on both himself and his crew, which exists in a shared consciousness within a tank of protoplasm. The book explores themes of isolation, identity, and the dangers of complacency in a high-tech environment.  In the story, Kelly, the engineer of a spacefaring vessel, finds himself increasingly concerned about the well-being of the ship and the crew, who have become overly content in their shared existence. While he believes that they should engage with their surroundings and confront potential dangers, the Crew—comfortably nestled in their blissful state—resists his urge to explore. Driven by a sense of duty and a desire to reawaken them to their own identities, Kelly takes drastic action, ultimately leading to catastrophic consequences. As he reckons with the aftermath of his decisions, he discovers a haunting realization about existence, survival, and the true nature of life, setting the stage for an introspective exploration of fate and reckoning.
