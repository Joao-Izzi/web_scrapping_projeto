    "resumo": "\"John Baring's House\" by Elsie Singmaster is a historical fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story primarily follows Elizabeth Scott and her brother Herbert as they return to their ancestral home to start anew after the death of their mother. Set in the aftermath of the Civil War, the book delves into themes of heritage, community challenges, and the complexities of lingering animosities tied to the past, particularly concerning the actions of Elizabeth's grandfather, John Baring.  The opening portion of the novel introduces Elizabeth and Herbert as they settle into their old family home, which has fallen into disrepair. While hopeful about reviving the property and making it a prosperous farm, they quickly realize that their grandfather's controversial past has left them socially ostracized in the community. Despite Elizabeth's firm demeanor and determination, they face hostility and suspicion from the locals, raising questions about their family's history, especially after a strange encounter with a man in the woods suggests that their grandfather may have betrayed his neighbors during the war. The sisters’ aspirations of establishing their orchard become increasingly complicated, hinting at deeper conflicts both personally and within the community as they grapple with the weight of their grandfather’s legacy.
