    "resumo": "\"Sun and Shadow in Spain\" by Maud Howe Elliott is a travel narrative written in the early 20th century. The book chronicles the author’s experiences as she explores Spain, delving into its rich history, culture, and landscapes, while also touching upon personal reflections and the interplay of light and shadow in her travels.   The opening of the work introduces the reader to Elliott’s long-held dream of traveling to Spain, sparked by childhood curiosity and imagination. As she arrives in Gibraltar, the author recounts her first impressions of the lively town and the influences of various cultures that shaped it, including those of the Moors and British. Elliott vividly captures her arrival experience, where she navigates her way through local customs, historical landmarks, and encounters colorful characters, including a comical local guide, setting the stage for her broader exploration of Spain’s diverse regions and rich heritage.
