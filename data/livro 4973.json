    "resumo": "\"The Powder Monkey\" by George Manville Fenn is a historical novel likely aimed at a younger audience, written in the late 19th century. The book centers around the harrowing experiences of a young boy, Phil Leigh, who escapes from an abusive uncle and finds refuge with an old seaman named Jack Jeens. Their lives take a dramatic turn when they are both pressed into service aboard HMS Victory during the renowned Battle of Trafalgar, a pivotal maritime conflict in British naval history.  The story follows Phil's transformation from a frightened young boy into a valued member of the crew as he takes on the role of a powder monkey, responsible for fetching gunpowder during battles. Despite the hardships, Phil finds camaraderie among the sailors, particularly with Jack, who becomes both a protector and a father figure to him. The narrative captures the complexity of their emerging bond, the harsh realities of naval life, and the chaos of war, culminating in the aftermath of Trafalgar, where both characters experience personal growth and resolution. The book concludes with Phil being reunited with his aunt, departing from the ship he has come to call home, but not before solidifying a promise to remain connected with Jack.
