    "resumo": "\"Comedias, tomo 1 de 3: Los Acarnienses, los Caballeros, las Nubes\" by Aristophanes is a collection of ancient Greek comedies likely written in the 5th century BC. This work presents an engaging exploration of Athenian society during the Peloponnesian War through ribald humor and sharp political satire. The main character in the opening play, \"Los Acarnienses,\" is Diceópolis, a common man who seeks peace amidst the chaos of war, representing the voices of ordinary citizens disillusioned by relentless conflict.  The opening of \"Los Acarnienses\" introduces us to Diceópolis, who reflects on his dismal state amidst the turmoil of the Peloponnesian War. Despite his desire for peace, he finds the Athenian assembly deserted as citizens are distracted by trivial matters. Upon a tumultuous discussion about negotiating peace, he ultimately devises a personal truce with the Lacedemonians while poking fun at the ineffectiveness of public officials and diplomats. Through a series of humorous exchanges with a notary and various characters, the comedic narrative captures the absurdities of war and politics, while simultaneously exploring the broader human desire for stability and comfort in challenging times.
