The story revolves around the Toodleburg family, particularly focusing on Hanz Toodleburg, his wife Angeline, and their son Titus Bright.

It describes Hanz's amiable relationship with his wife, Angeline, and their desire for children, which has been a source of gossip in their community due to their lack of offspring.
