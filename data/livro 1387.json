    "resumo": "\"The Peace of Roaring River\" by George Van Schaick is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the lives of Hugo Ennis, a young man living in the wilderness of Carcajou, and Madge Nelson, a girl from New York City who seeks a new life away from her difficult past. As the narrative unfolds, it explores themes of love, personal endeavor, and the contrasting lifestyles of urban and rural settings.  The opening of the novel introduces the village of Carcajou during the spring as Hugo arrives with plans to build a log cabin. We also meet Sophia McGurn, who finds herself scorned by Hugoâ€™s indifference to her advances. Meanwhile, Madge, recovering from illness in New York, becomes intrigued by a matrimonial advertisement, ultimately leading her to decide to travel to Carcajou to meet Hugo. This sets in motion a series of events that highlight both characters' struggles and aspirations. The stage is set for their eventual meeting and the unfolding of their intertwined destinies against the backdrop of the rugged wilderness. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
