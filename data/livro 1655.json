    "resumo": "\"The Brute\" by Frederic Arnold Kummer is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows the troubled relationship of Donald and Edith Rogers, a married couple living in Harlem, highlighting their struggles with poverty, ambition, and unfulfilled desires. Their interactions reveal the emotional and psychological conflicts surrounding their marriage, particularly Edith's dissatisfaction with her life.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Donald and Edith as they labor in their small, decorated but inadequate apartment. The atmosphere is one of tension; Donald is dedicated to his work and ambitions, while Edith expresses her frustration and desire for a more fulfilling life amidst their continuing financial struggles. As they discuss their lives, it becomes clear that Edith longs for experiences and luxuries that her circumstances cannot provide, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of their marriage and the dynamics that challenge their love and commitment, especially with the reappearance of Donaldâ€™s wealthy friend, Billy West.
