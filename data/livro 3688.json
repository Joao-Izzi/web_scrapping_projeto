    "resumo": "\"Induction Coils, How to Make, Use, and Repair Them\" by H. S. Norrie is a detailed scientific publication likely written during the late 19th century. This work focuses on the construction and application of induction coils, particularly the Ruhmkorff type, and covers various aspects including their use in gas engines, medicine, and wireless telegraphy.   The opening of this book introduces the concept of induction coils and the fundamental principles behind their operation. It specifically discusses the construction of the Ruhmkorff coil, emphasizing the relationship between the primary and secondary coils, as well as the materials required for building them. Norrie elaborates on factors affecting the induced current, such as wire specifications and the need for proper insulation, while also providing guidance for those looking to construct their own coils efficiently. This foundational coverage sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of induction coils throughout the rest of the publication. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
