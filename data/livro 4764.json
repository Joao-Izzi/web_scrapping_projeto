    "resumo": "\"The Torch-Bearers: A Satirical Comedy in Three Acts\" by George Kelly is a play likely written in the early 20th century. This satirical comedy explores themes surrounding amateur theater and the lives of its characters, particularly the seemingly mishap-prone yet earnest participants of a local production. The play presents a comical look at the intersection of societal norms and the theatrical world, as portrayed through the experiences of the central characters, including Frederick Ritter and his wife, Paula, among others.  The opening of \"The Torch-Bearers\" introduces the audience to the domestic setting of Frederick Ritter's home, where preparations for a rehearsal in which his wife, Paula, is involved are underway. As Ritter returns unexpectedly from a trip, interactions with the housemaid Jenny and conversations about Paula's entry into the amateur play reveal both humor and chaos that often accompanies such productions. Ritter's growing skepticism about the motivations and talent of the characters around him, especially regarding Mrs. Pampinelli, the production's organizer, highlights the comedic tone of the play, setting the stage for the humorous situations and character dynamics to unfold in subsequent acts.
