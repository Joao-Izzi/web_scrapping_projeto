    "resumo": "\"The Pretty Sister of José\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around José, a kind but slow-witted carpenter, and his beautiful sister Pepita as they navigate their new life outside Madrid after escaping poverty. Pepita's youth and beauty captivate those around her, while her fierce independence shapes her character and influences her relationships, especially with the renowned matador, Sebastiano.  The opening of the novel introduces us to José and Pepita as they begin anew in a small cottage, having left behind a harsh existence under the care of their unkind uncle. José finds fulfillment in his work and dreams of a better life for Pepita, who blossoms in her newfound surroundings filled with love and laughter. However, her disdain for marriage and suitors sets the stage for tension in her relationships, particularly with Sebastiano. Despite José's support and Pepita's enchanting qualities, her determination to remain independent hints at an underlying conflict that will challenge their bonds and test her resolve as the story unfolds.
