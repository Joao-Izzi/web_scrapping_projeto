    "resumo": "\"La maison des hommes vivants\" by Claude Farrère is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is narrated by an elderly man, André Narcy, who is confronting his impending death and has resolved to share a significant Secret with the world that he believes poses a terrible danger to humanity.   The opening of the novel introduces Narcy as he grapples with his age and deteriorating health, feeling as though he is on the brink of death at an indeterminate age that could exceed a hundred years. Despite his frailty, he senses an urgent duty to convey his story, which begins with a letter from a colonel that sets off a chain of events leading him to the fort of Grand Cap. The narrative quickly shifts to a tense atmosphere as Narcy embarks on a mission that intertwines with his past, particularly his romantic involvement with a woman named Madeleine, inserting layers of both personal and collective stakes into his final adventure. As he navigates the treacherous landscape, the mystery of his meeting with Madeleine haunts him, while the quest for the Secret looms heavily on his mind.
