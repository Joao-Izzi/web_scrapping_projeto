    "resumo": "\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" by Edwin L. Sabin is a short story written in the early 20th century. This engaging tale encapsulates the life and attitudes of a cowboy in the Western United States, providing a window into the culture of ranching and the experiences of rough-and-tumble life on the range. The story delves into themes of personal struggle, the complexities of human relationships, and the often transient nature of a cowboy's lifestyle.  The plot follows Laramie Red, a seasoned cowboy who faces the repercussions of being fired by the owner of the Seventy-seven ranch after a misunderstanding about his handling of a horse. Laramie's pride is wounded, prompting him to declare his intention to quit riding and seek a new life in the city of Kansas City. As he embarks on this new journey, he possesses a mix of hopes and apprehensions. His time in the city is marked by a comic exploration of urban life, testing his resolve and ultimately leading to familiar cowboy adventures. Ultimately, Laramie's character embodies the \"easy come, easy go\" philosophy, reflecting on the cyclical nature of his life and the inevitability of returning to the cowboy way in the end.
