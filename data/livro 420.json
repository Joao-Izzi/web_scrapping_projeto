    "resumo": "\"By Wit of Woman\" by Arthur W. Marchmont is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book unfolds in a backdrop filled with intrigue and personal conflict, centering around Christabel von Dreschler, a young woman who grapples with her father's disgrace and her own journey for justice. The narrative promises themes of deception, love, and the pursuit of truth, as Christabel navigates the treacherous waters of society, politics, and personal relationships.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Christabel, who discovers letters revealing the story of her father's wrongful imprisonment and dishonor, stemming from a murder he did not commit. As she reads about the pain and persistence of Ernst von Dreschler, her father, it becomes clear that Christabel is determined to uncover the truth behind his demise. The plot thickens with the introduction of General von Erlanger, a powerful figure in the local government, and his connection to her father's past. Christabel quickly realizes that to clear her father's name and make sense of her own place in the world, she must employ her wit and charm, as she positions herself against formidable forces, including Madame d'Artelle and Count Karl. This sets the stage for a blend of personal growth and wider societal conflicts, suggesting a compelling and multi-layered narrative to follow. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
