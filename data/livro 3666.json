    "resumo": "\"A Comparative View of Religions\" by Johannes Henricus Scholten is a scholarly examination of various religious systems, likely written during the late 19th century. The book aims to analyze religions through the lens of psychological development, providing insights into how different cultures and societies have conceptualized the divine and humanity's relationship with it. It provides a structured comparison of the evolution of religious beliefs from primitive forms to more complex systems.  In this work, Scholten traces the development of religious thought and practices across various cultures, beginning with the most basic expressions such as fetichism among indigenous peoples, and progressing through structured belief systems like those of the Chinese, Egyptians, Persian Zoroastrianism, and the Indian religions including Brahminism and Buddhism. He provides a detailed overview of how each religion developed its concepts of divinity and morality, highlighting key figures and philosophical underpinnings. The text culminates with a discussion on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, pointing out their historical roots and shared concepts while celebrating the evolution of religious thought toward a more personal and moral understanding of the divine.
