    "resumo": "\"The Lamplighter\" by Maria S. Cummins is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story centers around a young girl named Gerty, who is an orphan living in an unkind home with a woman named Nan Grant. The book explores Gerty's hardships and her longing for affection, as well as her interactions with a lamplighter named Trueman Flint, who becomes a protector and friend.\"  \"The opening of the novel introduces Gerty, a neglected and unloved eight-year-old girl, who watches the lamplighter in her impoverished neighborhood. She experiences abuse from Nan Grant and feels isolated from the world around her. One evening, while watching the lamplighter, she spills a jug of milk and is punished. Afterward, she encounters Trueman Flint, who shows her kindness by gifting her a kitten. The narrative sets a somber tone as it contrasts Gerty's bleak reality with her small moments of hope and care, establishing the themes of neglect, friendship, and the yearning for love.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
