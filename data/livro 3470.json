    "resumo": "\"True Version of the Philippine Revolution\" by Emilio Aguinaldo is a historical account likely written in the late 19th century, during the tumultuous period surrounding the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonization. As the President of the Philippine Republic, Aguinaldo provides a firsthand perspective on the events leading to the fight for independence, detailing the struggles and aspirations of the Filipino people during this pivotal moment in their history.  In the narrative, Aguinaldo recounts the various uprisings against Spanish rule, the establishment of a revolutionary government, and his engagement with American authorities during the brief alliance against Spain. Following the victory at Manila, Aguinaldo describes the promises made by American officials regarding Filipino independence, only for those hopes to be dashed as the U.S. soon sought to assert control over the Philippines instead. Through a mixture of personal experiences and broader revolutionary context, Aguinaldo seeks to document the fervent desire for freedom and the complexities of international relations that ultimately shaped the fate of the Philippines. The text serves as both an account of revolution and a plea for recognition of the Philippines' right to self-determination. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
