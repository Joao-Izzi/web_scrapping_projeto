    "resumo": "\"Viisas tyttö\" by Lucy Bethia Walford is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Elma, a young orphan raised by her guardian, Miss Exeter, in a rather distant and formal setting. The narrative explores themes of societal expectations, family dynamics, and Elma's quest for identity and belonging as she interacts with her more affluent relatives.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Elma, who is navigating her dual existence between her life under Miss Exeter’s strict guardianship and her visits to her wealthier relatives, the Alfretons. In their home, Elma is affectionately referred to as “the wise one,” a nickname that contrasts sharply with how she is seen in her other environment, where she is viewed as naive. We see the stark differences between the two households through their interactions and Elma's cheerful demeanor, which remains intact despite the emotional distance from her relatives. Lady Alfreton and Piers, her cousin, engage with Elma in a mix of genuine affection and condescension, while the underlying tension reveals differing views on upbringing and societal norms. This beginning sets the stage for Elma’s unique position as she seeks acceptance in a world defined by class and propriety. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
