    "resumo": "\"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman\" by Josephine Chase is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Marjorie Dean, a spirited and determined young girl who is facing the challenges of starting her freshman year at a new high school after moving away from her hometown. As she navigates her new environment, the book explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the struggles of fitting in while dealing with the complexities of adolescence.  At the start of the novel, Marjorie is reluctantly preparing to leave her cherished friendship with Mary, her closest companion from her old school. The opening chapters capture their emotional farewell and introduce the reader to Marjorie's new life in Sanford, where she grapples with homesickness and uncertainties about her new classmates. Despite her initial trepidation, Marjorie is determined to make a positive impression; however, she quickly realizes that the social dynamics at her new school are fraught with challenges, including a potential friendship with Constance, a girl perceived as an outcast by the more popular clique. As Marjorie strives to establish herself, her strong sense of justice and loyalty come into conflict with the snobbish attitudes of some of her new peers, setting the stage for further adventures and personal growth.
