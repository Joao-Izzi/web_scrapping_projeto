    "resumo": "\"Quatro Novelas\" by Ana de Castro Osório is a collection of fictional narratives written in the early 20th century. The book consists of four separate tales, which delve into themes of love, loss, and the complexities of human emotions. The opening story, \"A Vinha,\" introduces us to Luis, who returns to his hometown after a decade away, navigating feelings of nostalgia and emotional turmoil as he confronts his past and the changes that have occurred.  At the start of \"A Vinha,\" Luis reflects on his long absence from his childhood home, feeling as if he is a stranger returning from a different life. His journey back is marked by intense emotions, as he wrestles with guilt over being kept away from his family, particularly from his sister Eduarda, who has written to him with a warmth that contrasts with his feelings of betrayal and shame. As he attempts to reconnect with the memories of his youth, he discovers that the world he left behind is irrevocably altered—especially as he confronts the physical changes to the family home, now overrun by unfamiliarity. The narrative captures the bittersweet essence of revisiting one’s roots, blending personal reflections with the overarching theme of change and loss. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
