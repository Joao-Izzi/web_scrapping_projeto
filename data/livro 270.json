    "resumo": "\"Dorian Grayn muotokuva\" by Oscar Wilde is a novel written in the late 19th century.\" The story revolves around the handsome young man Dorian Gray and his relationship with two significant figures: the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait, and the hedonistic lord Henry Wotton, whose influence leads Dorian to pursue a life of aestheticism and sensual pleasure. The novel explores themes of beauty, morality, and the dualities of human nature.  \"The opening of the novel presents us with the atmosphere of an artist's studio, fragrant with flowers, and introduces the characters of Basil Hallward and lord Henry Wotton.\" Basil is painting the portrait of the exceptionally beautiful Dorian Gray, and there is a sense of tension regarding the artist's feelings about his work and the inspiration behind it. Lord Henry, a charismatic figure, provocatively engages with Basil about the nature of fame, beauty, and art, and expresses a desire to meet the enchanting Dorian. The scene sets the stage for the unfolding drama as Dorian is soon to enter their lives, marking a turning point in the narrative and hinting at deeper explorations of vanity and moral decay as the story progresses.
