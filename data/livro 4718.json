    "resumo": "\"A Study of Poetry\" by Bliss Perry is a scholarly examination of poetry, likely written in the early 20th century. The work introduces a genetic method of analyzing poetry, emphasizing the interconnected processes of impression, imaginative transformation, and expression. It aims to elucidate the nature of poetic creation and its aesthetic principles, particularly focusing on the lyric form, which captures the contemporary reader's interest in poetry.  The opening portion of the book sets the stage for an exploration of poetry's significance in human experience by juxtaposing the poet's artistic process with everyday observations, such as a woman gardening. Perry's reflections on the transformative power of poetry suggest that it transcends mere expression and taps into deeper emotional truths. He acknowledges the complexity of poetic study, recognizing various influences from aesthetics, history, and the arts. Moreover, he discusses the integral role of the imagination in poetry, alluding to aesthetic inquiries from ancient Greek philosophy to modern interpretations, positing that true poetry involves a synthesis of various sensory and emotional experiences.
