    "resumo": "\"Ole Mammy's Torment\" by Annie F. Johnston is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the life of a spirited young boy named John Jay Hickman and his relationships with his family, particularly his grandmother, Sheba, and his mischievous antics with his siblings. The narrative paints a vivid picture of life in the rural South, capturing both the joys and challenges faced by the African American community during this period.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the lively household dynamics of John Jay and his siblings living with their grandmother. We witness the tumultuous yet humorous interactions between John Jay and his \"Mammy,\" characterized by his boyish mischief and her loving yet stern discipline. The scene vividly illustrates the chaos of a typical morning, where the innocent antics of the children often lead to trouble, especially for John Jay, who is portrayed as both adventurous and a bit cheeky. The warmth of familial bonds, cultural nuances, and the struggles of the characters against their humble beginnings create a rich and engaging backdrop for the unfolding story.
