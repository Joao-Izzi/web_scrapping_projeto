    "resumo": "\"American Poetry, 1922: A Miscellany\" by Robert Frost et al. is a collection of contemporary poetry written in the early 20th century. This anthology features works from various prominent poets of the time, showcasing their individual styles and themes without the guidance of a single editor. The likely topic of the collection revolves around the diverse expressions and experiments in American poetry during this period, capturing a wide range of emotional and philosophical explorations.  The opening of this miscellany begins with a foreword that discusses the unique structure and purpose of the anthology. The foreword clarifies that this collection is a biennial follow-up to a previous volume, following an imitative plan akin to English anthologies. It emphasizes that the contributors were invited based on their individual contributions rather than a cohesive theme, highlighting the varied poetic voices included. The initial poems featured in this section suggest an exploration of human experiences through nature, love, and the nuances of contemporary life, setting the stage for a rich tapestry of poetic expression throughout the entire collection.
