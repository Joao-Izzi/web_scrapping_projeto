    "resumo": "\"Walks in Rome\" by Augustus J. C. Hare is a travelogue written in the late 19th century. This two-volume work serves as a guide for travelers seeking to navigate the Eternal City by providing insights, historical context, and practical information. The text not only focuses on Rome's famous landmarks but also delves into lesser-known sites, catering to those who desire a deeper understanding of the city's rich tapestry of history and culture.  At the start of the book, Hare sets the stage for the profound emotions many experience upon arriving in Rome, likening it to a reunion with a long-awaited friend.

To assist these travelers, Hare offers a thoughtful compilation of practical advice, such as recommendations for lodging, dining, and navigating the complex geography of the city.
