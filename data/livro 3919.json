    "resumo": "\"Olivier Twist: Les voleurs de Londres\" by Charles Dickens is a novel written in the early 19th century.\" The story delves into the life of Oliver Twist, a young orphan navigating the harsh realities of a society marked by poverty and cruelty. It showcases his struggles against the systemic injustices in Victorian England, introducing readers to a host of characters both despicable and sympathetic as Oliver endeavors to find his place in a world that seems intent on oppressing him.  \"At the start of the narrative, we witness the grim circumstances of Oliver's birth in a workhouse, where his mother dies shortly after giving birth.\" As a consequence of being an orphan, he is raised in conditions that are woefully inadequate, experiencing severe neglect and cruelty. The text highlights the government's callous treatment of the poor through the workings of the workhouse, setting the stage for Oliver's journey. Faced with hunger and maltreatment, Oliver's fate takes a pivotal turn early on when he boldly asks for more food, a plea that leads to dire consequences and illustrates his budding resilience against the injustices he faces.
