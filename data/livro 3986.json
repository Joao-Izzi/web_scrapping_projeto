    "resumo": "\"Gutenberg, pièce historique en 5 actes, 8 tableaux\" by Louis Figuier is a historical play written in the late 19th century. The narrative revolves around the life and ambitions of Jean Gutenberg, an ambitious inventor determined to revolutionize the way books are produced. Set during the early days of the printing press in Europe, the play explores themes of innovation, ambition, and the interactions between love and personal aspiration.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to the character of Jean Gutenberg in Mayence, where he grapples with his decision to abandon his successful career as an orfèvre (goldsmith) to pursue an invention that would allow for the mass production of written works. He confides in his sister Hébèle about his dreams and his desire to free humanity from the burdensome work of hand-copying texts, all while facing societal pressure and the threat from those who misunderstand his intentions. As he prepares to leave for a new chapter in his life, the stage is set for the conflicts between his creative ambitions, the love he shares with Annette, and the societal changes heralded by the advent of the printing press.
