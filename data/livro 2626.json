    "resumo": "\"Pauline, ou la liberté de l'amour\" by Louis Dumur is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the character of Pauline, a woman entangled in the complexities of love and marriage, reflecting on the nature of her relationships and the societal constraints imposed on her. The book seems to explore themes of personal freedom, the essence of true love, and the dissonance between emotional fulfillment and social conventions surrounding marriage.  The opening of the novel introduces Pauline and her husband, Facial, in a conversation about aging, love, and the nature of their relationship. As they discuss their thoughts on marriage and fidelity, Pauline expresses frustration at the superficiality of her husband's views and their lack of deep emotional connection. Through their dialogue, it becomes apparent that Pauline feels trapped in a conventional marriage, lacking the passionate love that she yearns for. The discord between their perspectives raises poignant questions about societal norms, desire, and what it means to truly love someone, foreshadowing the inner turmoil Pauline will face as the narrative unfolds.
