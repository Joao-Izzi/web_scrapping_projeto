    "resumo": "\"Le Docteur Ox\" by Jules Verne is a novel written during the late 19th century. This work is set in the small, fictitious town of Quiquendone, characterized by its tranquil and seemingly uneventful life. The story revolves around the enigmatic character of Doctor Ox, a scientist who arrives in the town to implement a bold gas lighting project, which stirs the suppressed emotions and passions of the otherwise calm inhabitants.  At the start of \"Le Docteur Ox,\" readers are introduced to Quiquendone, a quaint town that is inexplicably absent from maps, despite its long history. The opening chapters depict a series of humorous and lively interactions among the town's leaders, particularly the sluggish mayor, Van Tricasse, and his advisor, Niklausse, as they discuss mundane administrative matters. The arrival of Doctor Ox and the news of a political dispute between the local lawyer and doctor foreshadow the upheaval soon to come. The seemingly inconsequential discussions reveal a deep-rooted obscurity in the town's character and pave the way for Oxâ€™s experiment, which promises to ignite unforeseen passions and alter the calm dynamics of Quiquendone forever.
