    "resumo": "\"A New Species of Frog (Genus Tomodactylus) from Western México\" by Robert G. Webb is a scientific publication written in the early 1960s. This work is categorized as a research paper focused on the field of herpetology, specifically detailing the discovery of a new frog species in Western Mexico. The book likely addresses the scientific aspects of taxonomy, anatomy, and habitat that pertain to this newly identified species.  In this study, Webb presents findings from the collection of thirteen specimens of frogs from Durango and Sinaloa. He formally describes the species as \"Tomodactylus saxatilis\", providing comprehensive morphological details that differentiate it from other species in the genus. The paper includes the specific measurements and characteristics of the holotype and paratypes, alongside habitat descriptions that indicate a preference for rocky environments. The publication also discusses the similarities and distinctions between \"Tomodactylus saxatilis\" and other related species, contributing to the broader understanding of amphibian diversity in the region.
