    "resumo": "\"Morphological Variation in a Population of the Snake, Tantilla gracilis Baird and Girard\" by Laurence M. Hardy and Charles J. Cole is a scientific publication written in the late 20th century. This study explores the morphological variations found among a population of the flat-headed snake, \"Tantilla gracilis\", specifically focusing on specimens collected in Kansas during the late 1930s to early 1940s. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the snake's taxonomic characteristics and examine potential variations relevant to its classification.  The book presents a detailed analysis of the morphological traits of 246 specimens, examining various external and maxillary characteristics, including scale counts, ventral and subcaudal numbers, and the structure of the maxillae. The study reports that a significant proportion of the specimens display atypical characteristics compared to the common traits expected for the species. The authors also evaluate past research on \"Tantilla gracilis\", addressing the perceived need for the recognition of subspecies based on variations observed. Ultimately, Hardy and Cole conclude that the variations do not warrant separate subspecies classification, supporting the idea that the differences within the population are not significant enough to define distinct taxonomic groups.
