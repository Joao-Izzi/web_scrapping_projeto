    "resumo": "\"McClure's Magazine, Vol 31, No 2, June 1908\" by Various is a periodical publication written in the early 20th century. This edition features a collection of articles, essays, and stories that explore a variety of topics ranging from personal narratives to historical accounts. Notable pieces include Ellen Terry's reflections on her first performances in America and a critical analysis of President Johnson's policies during a turbulent period in U.S. history.  At the start of the magazine, the opening contribution is Ellen Terry's autobiographical piece, \"My First Appearance in America.\" Terry recounts her apprehensive yet excited journey to America in 1883, reflecting on her experiences and impressions of American cities, especially New York. She describes her initial fears, the warm reception by American audiences, and observations of cultural differences in fashion and society. Terry's narrative offers an engaging glimpse into the world of theatre, her pioneering role in American productions, and the society she encountered during her visits.
