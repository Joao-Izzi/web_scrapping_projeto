    "resumo": "\"Koti ja maailma\" by Rabindranath Tagore is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story deals with the complexities of love, nationalism, and social reform as seen through the eyes of its central character, Bimala, who finds herself torn between the traditional values of home and the emerging nationalist fervor represented by her husband, Nikhil, and his friend, Sandip. As Bimala navigates her evolving identity, the narrative explores the clashes between personal desires and societal expectations during a time of significant political unrest in India.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Bimala as she reflects on her relationship with her mother and her childhood memories, setting the stage for her eventual marriage to a progressive man, Nikhil. Berging on her new life, Bimala grapples with the expectations placed upon her as a wife and the dichotomy between her established identity and the desire for personal autonomy. The tensions of the broader socio-political landscape begin to seep into her domestic life, hinting at the conflicts that will arise as the swadeshi movement gains momentum. As Bimala's thoughts and sentiments unfold, we see the foundations for her internal struggle between her loyalty to tradition and her exploration of a new world of possibilities.
