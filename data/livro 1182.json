    "resumo": "\"Kitty Carstairs\" by J. J. Bell is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Kitty Carstairs, a young woman living in a dull village, who longs for adventure and independence from her oppressive relatives. The narrative unfolds her struggles with familial expectations and unrequited affection, particularly with Colin Hayward, who feels suffocated by his own family's ambitions for him.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to Kitty as she watches the London mail train pass through her village, sparking her dreams of departure. Kitty is soon confronted by Colin Hayward, who has just returned home after failing yet again to meet his family's expectations of him. Their conversation reveals both of their discontent with their respective lives and hints at Kitty's desire to escape the confines of her aunt and uncle's household. The opening chapters vividly depict Kitty's emotional landscape as she navigates her unacknowledged feelings for Colin while also facing the pressure from her relatives to marry a man named Alec Symington, whom she detests. The intricate dynamics of their relationships set the stage for Kitty's quest for personal freedom and self-discovery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
