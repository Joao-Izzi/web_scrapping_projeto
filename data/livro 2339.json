The opening portion of the story introduces us to Molly and her complex family dynamics, particularly concerning Aunt Clay, who is opposed to their travel due to an ongoing legal complication involving oil discovered on their land.

As they set sail for Antwerp on a steamer, Molly and her mother make acquaintances with fellow passengers, namely the intriguing Kinsella duo and others aboard, hinting at the relationships and adventures they will encounter in their new Parisian life.
