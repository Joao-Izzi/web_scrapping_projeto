The story revolves around Archibold Masterman, a self-made man who rises from humble beginnings as a laborer to a prominent and wealthy figure in London society. The narrative explores themes of ambition, social class, morality, and the complexities of family relationships, particularly focusing on Archibold's relationship with his son, Arthur.  The opening of the novel introduces Archibold Masterman as a successful builder who has crafted a life of respectability and social standing through risky business ventures and self-promotion. He is portrayed as a complex character, blending ambition with a certain unscrupulousness, as he navigates the social dynamics of his neighborhood, Highbourne Gardens. As he grapples with his past and present decisions, a conflict arises in his household due to Arthur’s burgeoning ideals, influenced by modern thoughts on morality and society, especially after Arthur’s return from Oxford.
