    "resumo": "\"American Red Cross Text-Book on Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick\" by Jane A. Delano is a practical guide on health and nursing care written in the early 20th century. Aimed particularly at women and family caretakers, the text offers essential knowledge for preventing disease and effectively caring for the sick at home, while addressing the need for health education in communities during times of medical personnel shortages.   The opening of the book presents a preface that emphasizes the importance of home hygiene and caring for the sick, especially during critical periods such as wartime when trained healthcare providers may be limited. It underscores that many illnesses, particularly communicable diseases, can be prevented through knowledge of basic hygiene practices and proper care methods. The author advocates for accessible education on these subjects, aiming to enable every household to manage health concerns more effectively while supporting public health initiatives within their communities. This lays a foundation for the structured content that follows, which includes detailed chapters on causes of sickness, hygiene practices, and caregiving methods essential for maintaining health within families.
