    "resumo": "\"Edward MacDowell, His Work and Ideals\" by Elizabeth Fry Page is a biography written during the early 20th century. The book explores the life and musical philosophy of Edward MacDowell, an influential American composer. It delves into MacDowell's creative inspirations, influences from both the European musical tradition and his American roots, and the ideals that shaped his artistic expression.  In this comprehensive study, Elizabeth Fry Page presents both an appreciation of MacDowell's contribution to music and a detailed analysis of his compositions, which often draw upon poetic themes. The text includes poetic interpretations inspired by his works, connecting the music to natural elements and emotional experiences that resonate with the listener. It addresses MacDowell's struggles, his deep connection with nature, and the mysticism that colored much of his music. Page also reflects on the importance of fostering creativity in a supportive environment, as exemplified by MacDowell's vision for the MacDowell Colony in Peterboro, New Hampshire, a retreat for artists and musicians aiming to cultivate their craft.
