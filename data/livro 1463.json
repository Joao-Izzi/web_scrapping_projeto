    "resumo": "\"A fond de cale\" by Mayne Reid is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Philippe Forster, an old sea captain who lives in a small bay village, as he relates his adventurous past to a group of curious young boys. The narrative begins with the captain's reflections on his life, establishing his connection to the sea and hinting at the exciting tales he holds from his youthful adventures.  The opening of the novel sets the stage with Philippe sharing his background and the simple life he leads now, juxtaposed against the excitement of his childhood. He enjoys the admiration of local children who are eager to hear his stories, leading him to recount his first maritime expedition. The boysâ€™ eagerness prompts him to begin a tale of his boyhood exploits, which includes a perilous incident involving his passion for the water, the loss of his boat, and his struggle against the sea. As he prepares to share, the reader gets a sense of both nostalgia and the thrill of adventure that will unfold in the chapters to come. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
