    "resumo": "\"Kindheit: Autobiographische Novelle\" by Leo N. Tolstoi is an autobiographical novella written in the mid-19th century. The work captures the formative experiences of Tolstoi's early life through the lens of a young boy's memories, focusing on his relationships with family and teachers. The novella delves into themes of innocence, the complexity of growing up, and the nuances of human interaction, particularly as experienced in childhood.  The opening of \"Kindheit\" introduces us to the protagonist, a young boy just after his eleventh birthday, as he grapples with the daily realities of school life and his interactions with his teacher, Karl Iwanowitsch. Conflicted feelings emerge as he initially feels annoyed by his teacher's methods but quickly realizes the man's kindness. The narrative weaves together moments of tender self-reflection and vivid observations about the people around him, including his family, like his mother and brother, and their interactions with household staff. Through the lens of innocence and the emotional rollercoaster of childhood, Tolstoi begins to create a rich tapestry of his early experiences that promises a deeper exploration in the pages to come.
