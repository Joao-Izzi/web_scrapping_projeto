    "resumo": "\"Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain\" by Oliver Optic is a novel for young readers written during the late 19th century. The story revolves around Lawry Wilford, a fourteen-year-old boy who is a skilled pilot on Lake Champlain. The book showcases Lawry's adventures at sea, including a harrowing encounter with a squall, the challenges he faces with his family dynamics, and his aspirations to navigate and manage a steamboat.  The opening portion of the tale introduces Lawry aboard the sloop \"Missisque\", where he warns Captain John about an approaching squall. Although the captain is initially distracted by his meal, the young pilot's concerns soon materialize as the storm hits, leading to a chaotic situation where the sail is damaged. Concurrently, a bank director named Mr. Randall, who is traveling with them, is preoccupied with a substantial sum of money he carries. After the squall, Lawry lands at his father's ferry and learns that Mr. Sherwood is looking for a pilot. The narrative sets the stage for Lawry's exploration of his ambitions while hinting at the complexities of his family life, particularly with his father, who aspires to wealth but often succumbs to laziness and discontent.
