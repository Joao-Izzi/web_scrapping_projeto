    "resumo": "\"Hogarth's Works, with Life and Anecdotal Descriptions of His Pictures\" is an artistic critique and biography compiled by John Ireland and John Nichols, likely written in the late 18th century. This works aims to authenticate and detail the life of William Hogarth, an influential English painter and engraver known for his satirical and moralistic works. The narrative also delves into Hogarth’s opinions about the state of art in his time, the critiques he faced from contemporaries, and the evolution of his artistic career.  The opening of this volume introduces readers to Hogarth’s life story and artistic philosophy as he reflects on his early years, apprenticeship, and eventual emergence as a significant figure in the arts. Hogarth describes his discontentment with engraving silver-plate and his shift to copper engraving, illustrating his journey in developing his technique and artistic vision. He also touches on the misconceptions about his works that arose due to their inherent satire, explains his motivations behind choosing unique subjects compared to his peers, and asserts the necessity of drawing from life and nature rather than purely from imitation. Each anecdote and reflection in this beginning lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of Hogarth not just as an artist but as a keen observer of the human condition.
