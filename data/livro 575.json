    "resumo": "\"Days to Remember: The British Empire in the Great War\" by John Buchan and Henry Newbolt is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book provides an overview of the events and significant battles of World War I, particularly focusing on the experiences and contributions of the British Empire, including forces from Canada, Australia, and other Commonwealth nations. The narrative centers around the complex causes of the war, its key battles, and the collective effort of the British and their allies.  The opening of the book introduces the multiple causes that led to the outbreak of World War I. It discusses the rising tensions in Europe, particularly Germany's ambitions and the alliances formed among the other powers. The narrative details the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, which acted as a catalyst for the conflict, and subsequently outlines Britain’s difficult position as it moved from neutrality to involvement due to Germany’s invasion of Belgium. The first chapter sets the stage for a discussion of pivotal moments in the war by describing the initial strategies and responses of the major players, preparing readers for a deeper dive into the battles the British Empire would face.
