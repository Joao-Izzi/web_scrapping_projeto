    "resumo": "\"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\" by Kuno Francke and William Guild Howard is a collection of translated German literary masterpieces written in the early 20th century. This anthology features notable authors such as Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, and Clara Viebig, highlighting significant themes and styles present in German literature during this period. The collection provides insights into the cultural and philosophical undercurrents that influenced these writers and offers a window into the progression of German narrative art.  The opening of this volume introduces the essay \"The Contemporary Short Story\" by Julius Petersen, which reflects on the state of German literature during tumultuous times, particularly amidst the backdrop of war and national identity. It discusses the response of contemporary writers to societal changes and the evolving landscape of literature, contrasting naturalism with the emerging trends of Heimatkunst (art of the homeland) and neo-romanticism. Petersen emphasizes the impact of World War I on the artistic spirit, as authors grapple with themes of unity, identity, and the relationship between individual lives and the collective experience of the nation. Through this exploration, the opening sets the stage for the works contained in this collection, presenting a rich context for readers interested in the depth and diversity of German literary expression.
