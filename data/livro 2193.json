    "resumo": "\"Viajes de un Colombiano en Europa, primera serie\" by José María Samper is a travel narrative written in the mid-19th century.\" The work chronicles the author's adventurous journey as a Colombian traveler navigating the landscapes and cultures of Europe, including his reflections on the contrasts between his homeland and the diverse societies he encounters. Central to the narrative is the author himself, who poignantly reflects on the emotional weight of leaving Colombia for the unknown realms of Europe.  \"The opening of the book sets the stage for the author’s departure from his native Colombia, particularly focusing on the city of Honda, rich in natural beauty and personal memories.\" Samper captures the profound emotions he experiences as he bids farewell to his homeland. He describes Honda with vivid imagery, portraying it as a once-thriving port city now overshadowed by its ruins and rich flora. With a mixture of nostalgia and hope, the author conveys the complexity of his feelings about leaving behind the familiarity of Colombia as he embarks on a journey to explore European civilization, seeking knowledge and experience amidst its complexities and contrasts.
