    "resumo": "\"Laivuri on rakastunut: Merimiesjutelma\" by W. W. Jacobs is a fictional work likely written in the late 19th century. This story centers around a ship called \"Merilokki\" and its crew, particularly the captain, Wilson, who is portrayed as somewhat absent-minded, leading to various conflicts with the ship's first mate and crew. The narrative explores themes of love and misunderstandings, all set against a maritime backdrop.  The opening of the narrative introduces the setting aboard the \"Merilokki\" as it is docked in Northfleet, preparing to sail. The crew members are depicted in a somewhat comical light as they critique the captain's peculiar behavior and preoccupation, tied to a romantic interest back on land. The first mate's frustrations with the crew's lack of discipline and the ongoing banter among the men establish a lively atmosphere filled with tension and humor. As the plot unfolds, it becomes evident that the captain's infatuation complicates shipboard dynamics, as he is more concerned with his romantic pursuits than the business of sailing. This setup promises a mix of humor and drama as the story continues to develop. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
