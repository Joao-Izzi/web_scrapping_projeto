This educational text is geared towards children, structured mainly in folk rhymes, and serves to impart fundamental Christian doctrines and teachings in an engaging manner.   The book presents a systematic exploration of Christian beliefs, guiding young readers through key concepts of creation, original sin, and the life of Jesus Christ. Each chapter unfolds important biblical narratives, starting from the creation of the world, the fall of Adam and Eve, and extending to the teachings and miracles of Jesus. Written in a simple and child-friendly style, it uses verse to make theological concepts accessible, highlighting moral lessons such as obedience to God, the significance of the sacraments, and the importance of loving one another.
