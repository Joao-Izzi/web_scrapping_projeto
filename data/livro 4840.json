    "resumo": "\"Mightiest Qorn\" by Keith Laumer is a science fiction novella written during the early 1960s. The story revolves around a conflict initiated by the Qornt, a warlike alien race, who assert control over a human-inhabited planet and issue an ultimatum to the Terran diplomats. The narrative elegantly explores themes of diplomacy, aggression, and the humorous intricacies of inter-species relations.  The plot follows Ambassador Nitworth and his staff as they grapple with the emergence of the Qornt and their aggressive demands for occupation of the planet Smorbrod. Diplomatic envoy Magnan, accompanied by the resourceful Retief, sets out to investigate the Qornt on their home turf. Upon encountering the Qornt, they discover that the intimidating aliens are more interested in glory and adventure than outright conquest. This leads to a series of comedic exchanges as Retief finds a way to turn the situation to their advantage, ultimately suggesting a partnership with the Qornt rather than an all-out conflict. The book combines humor with elements of thrilling adventure, making it a captivating read for fans of science fiction and witty storytelling. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
