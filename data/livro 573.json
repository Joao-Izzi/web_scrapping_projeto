    "resumo": "\"Soldan's Geschichte der Hexenprozesse. Zweiter Band\" by Wilhelm Gottlieb Soldan is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work delves into the complex and harrowing history of witch trials, particularly focusing on events in Germany and beyond during the late medieval and early modern periods. Soldan examines the cultural, religious, and social implications of these trials, highlighting the figures and ideas that influenced the witch hunts.  The beginning of this volume outlines the contributions of key historical figures, notably Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim and Johann Weier, who challenged the prevailing superstitions surrounding witchcraft. It describes Agrippa's early life and his literary rebukes against witchcraft, setting the stage for the ongoing debates about the nature of witch trials during the Renaissance. Weier further develops arguments against the inquisition's practices, stressing the unjust treatment of those accused. The opening serves to establish the ideological framework leading to the witch trials, preparing the reader for a detailed exploration of the catastrophic impact of these processes on society.
