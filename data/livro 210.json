    "resumo": "\"The Oxford Book of American Essays\" by Brander Matthews is a collection of essays written in the early 20th century. The anthology brings together works from prominent American writers, showcasing the evolution and distinct flavor of American literature within the broader context of English literature. The collection addresses various themes, reflecting on the American experience and its unique contributions to the genre of the essay.  At the start of this anthology, the introduction by Brander Matthews discusses the relationship between American and English literature, emphasizing that while American literature is part of the English literary tradition, it is characterized by its own distinct qualities influenced by the unique American social and cultural landscape. In this context, the selection of essays aims to highlight typical examples of American contributions through the lens of various esteemed authors, such as Benjamin Franklin and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The opening portion sets the stage for a deeper exploration of individual essays and the insights they provide into American thought and life, all while critiquing the notion that American literature needs to be separate from its British counterpart.
