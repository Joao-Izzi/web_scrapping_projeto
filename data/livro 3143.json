    "resumo": "\"The Expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike, Volume 2 (of 3)\" by Pike and Coues is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This volume chronicles Pike's journey to the headwaters of the Mississippi River and through territories that would become part of New Spain during the years 1805 to 1807. It explores themes of exploration, interaction with indigenous peoples, and the challenges faced by Pike and his men.   At the start of Volume 2, the narrative focuses on Pike's \"Arkansaw Journey,\" beginning with the expedition's departure from Belle Fontaine. The text details the composition of the party, which includes officers, privates, and several indigenous chiefs and women, as they navigate the Missouri and Osage rivers toward the Pawnee Village. The account describes various encounters, the difficulties faced along the journey, and interactions with Native Americans, offering readers a glimpse into the challenges of early 19th-century exploration as well as the dynamics of cultural exchange and conflict.
