    "resumo": "\"Wolf's Head\" by Charles Egbert Craddock is a novel written in the early 20th century, likely during the 1910s. Set in a remote, wild region filled with dense forests and rugged terrain, the story explores themes of law, survival, and human connection amidst the backdrop of an outlaw's life. The plot primarily revolves around the character of a fugitive, known as the \"wolf's head,\" who is hiding from the law in a tree and the young woman who becomes intricately involved in his fate.  The narrative unfolds through the perspective of a group of sportsmen who are camping in the wilderness when they learn of the outlaw's presence in the area. Central to the story is Meddlesome, a young woman who embodies a unique blend of curiosity and empathy. Upon encountering the fugitive, she manages to maintain his trust while devising a plan to help him escape the dangers posed by law enforcement. The tension escalates as Meddlesome's meddling unwittingly leads to dramatic encounters with the law, all while dealing with the rustic charm and challenges of her environment.
