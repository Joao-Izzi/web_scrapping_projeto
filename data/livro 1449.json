    "resumo": "\"Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord\" by Alfred Döblin is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers around a young woman named Elli Link, who moves to Berlin seeking a lively existence, only to find herself caught in a tumultuous marriage to a struggling carpenter named Link, who becomes increasingly abusive. As the story unfolds, themes of love, betrayal, and the intoxicating nature of female friendships emerge, ultimately leading to a chilling examination of the darkness within human relationships.  The opening of the novel introduces Elli Link as a lively and carefree 19-year-old who, after a series of misadventures, falls for her serious and politically passionate husband, Link. The initial charm of their relationship soon gives way to a harsh reality, as Link's obsession and harsh behaviors create a toxic environment that suffocates Elli’s spirit. The passage reveals her growing resentment, her struggle with her identity, and the oppressive nature of her marriage. As she navigates these turbulent waters, her connection with another woman, Grete Bende, deepens, setting the stage for complex emotional entanglements that blur the lines between love, loyalty, and revenge, culminating in a shocking plot surrounding the notion of murder.
