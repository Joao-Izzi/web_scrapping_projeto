    "resumo": "\"Voyage au Centre de la Terre\" by Jules Verne is a classic science fiction novel written in the mid-19th century. The story follows Professor Otto Lidenbrock, a headstrong geologist, and his reluctant nephew Axel, as they embark on an adventurous journey to the Earth's core after discovering an ancient manuscript containing a cryptic message.   The beginning of the book introduces us to Axel and his eccentric uncle Lidenbrock, who is depicted as a brilliant yet irascible man obsessed with science. The plot kicks off when Lidenbrock finds a rare Icelandic manuscript that hints at a passage to the center of the Earth. Excited, he quickly engages Axel in a race against time to decode the manuscript. As the opening develops, readers are introduced to the domestic life in Hamburg and the contrarian nature of Lidenbrock, who often disregards the concerns of those around him. Axel's reservations about the journey are evident, foreshadowing an impending adventure filled with scientific exploration and personal challenge. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
