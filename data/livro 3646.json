    "resumo": "\"The Invader\" by Alfred Coppel is a science fiction novella published in the early 1950s. The story revolves around an alien being from the dying race of Triomeds who infiltrates Earth by taking over the body of a human host. Coppel explores themes of invasion, identity, and the alien perspective on humanity within a narrative that combines elements of suspense and horror.  In the plot, a Triomed scout, seeking to ensure the survival of his race, descends to Earth and successfully takes control of a human being. Initially reveling in the newfound sensations and potential for exploration, the Triomed's confidence quickly turns to panic as he realizes the deep fear he instills in humans, culminating in a deadly encounter with local authorities. The alien's attempts to navigate this foreign world slip into chaos as his disguise is discovered, and he faces the consequences of his invasion. Ultimately, he meets a tragic end, offering a poignant commentary on the collision of two vastly different worlds. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
