    "resumo": "\"Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf\" by George W. M. Reynolds is a gothic novel written in the mid-19th century. The story unfolds against the backdrop of early 16th century Germany, following the mysterious and tumultuous events surrounding an aged shepherd named Wagner and a charismatic stranger who offers him a chance at youth and riches with an ominous price. This tale blends elements of horror, romance, and supernatural themes, exploring Wagner's inner struggles and the ramifications of his decisions.  The opening portion introduces us to Wagner, a desolate old shepherd mourning the recent disappearance of his beloved granddaughter, Agnes. On a dark, stormy night, he receives an unexpected visitorâ€”a tall, enigmatic stranger who proposes a Faustian bargain that could restore Wagner's youth and vitality in exchange for a terrible condition he struggles to comprehend. The narrative weaves a sense of foreboding as Wagner contemplates the stranger's offer, ultimately succumbing to his despair and accepting the pact, albeit with trepidation. This sets the stage for a supernatural journey fraught with moral conflicts and consequences, a compelling hook for readers drawn to dark fantasies with intricate character arcs.
