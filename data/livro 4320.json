    "resumo": "\"Warrior of Two Worlds\" by Manly Wade Wellman is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story begins with the protagonist, Yandro, awakening on a strange planet called Dondromogon after being drawn from his home on Earth. As he navigates his new reality, he learns he is destined to lead the inhabitants of Dondromogon in their struggle against invaders known as the Newcomers.  The opening of the novel introduces Yandro's disorientation as he wakes in a dust storm, experiencing a mysterious voice asserting that he has been brought to Dondromogon for a vital purpose. He finds himself amid tension, intrigue, and an immediate conflict involving the military of Dondromogon, where he is accused of being a spy. As Yandro contends with his lost memory and struggles to assert his identity, he is caught between two forces: those who believe in his destiny and those who are skeptical of his claims. This sets the stage for a tale of adventure, leadership, and the exploration of memory and identity as he seeks to define his role in the unfolding battle.
