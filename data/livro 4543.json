    "resumo": "\"L'Adultera: Roman\" by Theodor Fontane is a novel written in the late 19th century. This work primarily explores themes of love, marriage, and societal expectations through the lives of its characters, particularly focusing on Melanie, the wife of the wealthy Kommerzienrat Van der Straaten. The narrative delves into the emotional and moral complexities surrounding infidelity and the constraints of societal norms.  The opening of \"L'Adultera\" introduces the affluent and somewhat self-satisfied Kommerzienrat Van der Straaten, who navigates his social standing with a mixture of humor and arrogance. He shares a seemingly happy marriage with his much younger wife, Melanie, yet hints at deeper undercurrents of dissatisfaction and longing for freedom in her character. As they engage in playful banter over breakfast, the text suggests that their relationship may be marked by frivolity on the surface while concealing unspoken tensions. Additionally, the arrival of a new guest in their household is hinted at, setting the stage for potential complications and developments in their lives, especially regarding Melanie's inner thoughts and desires.
