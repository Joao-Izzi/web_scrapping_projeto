    "resumo": "\"Spadacrene Anglica: The English Spa Fountain\" by Edmund Deane is a medical treatise written in the early 17th century. This work is primarily focused on the medicinal properties of the mineral waters at Harrogate, particularly the Tuewhit Well, which Deane famously extols as the \"English Spa\" in comparison to its German counterparts. The book not only serves as a historical account of the waters' significance but also discusses the natural environment surrounding them, marking it as an essential source for understanding early spa culture in England.  The opening of \"Spadacrene Anglica\" introduces readers to the historical and geographical context of Harrogate as a small village nestled within the Royal Forest of Knaresborough. Deane emphasizes the discovery of the Tuewhit Well's medicinal properties by Mr. William Slingsby, recounting the initial trials and promising results observed by medical practitioners of his time. The introduction also outlines Deane's motivation to publish this treatise, as he wants to rectify misunderstandings and inaccuracies in the accounts of the spa's history that have arisen since his discovery. Overall, the text establishes the foundation for a more scientific exploration of the waters, paving the way for later discussions on their therapeutic benefits.
