    "resumo": "\"Turgenev: A Study\" by Edward Garnett is a literary critique written in the early 20th century. The work focuses on the life and contributions of Russian author Ivan Turgenev, exploring his artistic genius and delving into the complexities of his characters and themes. Garnett draws attention to Turgenev's significance within Russian literature and the broader context of 19th-century social and political upheaval.  The opening of the study features an introduction by Joseph Conrad, who praises both Turgenev and Garnett's analytical prowess. It discusses Turgenev's position in literature as a writer whose work transcends the confines of his time, characterized by a deep empathy for human emotion and a nuanced understanding of society. Conrad reflects on how Turgenev's creations, particularly his depictions of women, remain timeless and resonate with readers beyond their immediate historical context. This initial segment sets the stage for a thorough investigation of Turgenev's critiques and the impact of his storytelling on generations of readers. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
