    "resumo": "\"Around the End\" by Ralph Henry Barbour is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the dynamics of youth and athletics, particularly focusing on the lives of students at a boarding school as they navigate challenges associated with football, friendship, and personal growth. The narrative offers an engaging glimpse into the experiences of the young characters, in particular, Kendall Burtis, as he strives to find his place within the school community.  At the start of the novel, the reader is introduced to the atmosphere at Yardley Hall School as football practice begins. Coach Payson gathers candidates for the team, including characters like Kendall Burtis and his friend Harry Merrow, who discuss their hopes for the upcoming season. The dynamics of competition and camaraderie unfold, especially as new and old players vie for positions on the team, with particular focus on Kendall's rise to prominence due to his goal-kicking skills. As the narrative progresses, the interactions between the various personalities, including the somewhat awkward newcomer Charles Cotton, set the stage for the unfolding drama and rivalries in their athletic endeavors.
