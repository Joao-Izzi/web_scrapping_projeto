    "resumo": "\"'Round the Yule-Log: Christmas in Norway\" by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen is a collection of holiday-themed stories and folklore written during the late 19th century. The book captures the spirit of Christmas in Norway, blending traditional tales with the warmth of family gatherings, reflecting the customs and culture of the time. Through its narrative, the book brings to life various characters, including trolls, brownies, and a cast of charming children and old maids, all set against a backdrop of festive cheer and nostalgia.  In this enchanting collection, the stories are woven together by a narrator who finds himself alone on Christmas Eve due to illness. He is invited to join two old maids and their lively nieces for the evening, where he recounts tales of folkloric creatures such as trolls and brownies. Throughout these narratives, themes of bravery, mischief, and the joys of Christmas festivities emerge. Stories such as the brave hunter Peter Gynt and his encounters with trolls, or the clever tales of brownies helping or hindering human lives, reflect the interplay of human emotions and folklore. The book culminates in a heartwarming reunion with family, embodying the spirit of togetherness typical of the holiday season. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
