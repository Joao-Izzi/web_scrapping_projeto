    "resumo": "\"Il costruttore Solness\" by Henrik Ibsen is a drama in three acts written in the late 19th century.\" The play centers around Halvard Solness, a master builder, and explores themes of ambition, insecurity, and the complexities of human relationships, particularly within the context of Solness' personal and professional life.  \"The opening of the play introduces us to the setting within Solness' workroom, where he interacts with various characters, including his wife Alina, his assistant Knut Brovik, and Kaja Fosli, creating tension that hints at underlying conflicts.\" Knut Brovik expresses concern about his son Ragnar's aspirations to become independent and build homes on his own; Solness appears reluctant to relinquish his control and authority. As their relationships unfold, it becomes clear that Solness harbors insecurities about his success and fears of being overshadowed by younger talents. The dynamic between Solness and Kaja hints at deeper emotional layers, as Kaja's affection for Ragnar and her interactions with Solness indicate a complicated web of desires and responsibilities.
