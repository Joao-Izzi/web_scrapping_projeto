The story centers around Marcellina, a pure and innocent young woman from the pastoral village of Nebiolo, and explores themes of love, simplicity, and the innocence of rural life.

Marcellina, the daughter of Giovanni, embodies innocence and grace as she tends to her household and embraces the joys of rural life.
