    "resumo": "\"The Gods of Mars\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a science fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story continues the adventures of John Carter, a prince of Mars, as he navigates a world filled with strange creatures and epic battles, searching for his beloved Dejah Thoris while encountering new threats and allies along the way.  At the start of the book, John Carter reflects on the passage of time since he last visited Mars, recalling his deep connections to the planet and the people. A telegram from his great-uncle, Captain John Carter, pulls him back into the narrative, leading to an exploration of Mars and an encounter with bizarre beings known as the Plant Men. Carter's opening experiences reveal a vivid, lush landscape juxtaposed with the monstrous Plant Men, hinting at the adventures and conflicts that await him in this fantastical setting. The tone is adventurous and filled with suspense, inviting readers to join Carter as he deals with both familiar adversaries and new foes. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
