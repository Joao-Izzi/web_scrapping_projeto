    "resumo": "\"The Hilltop Boys on Lost Island\" by Cyril Burleigh is a boys' adventure novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story centers around a group of boys from Hilltop Academy who embark on an educational voyage aboard a steam yacht, which leads them to a mysterious and uncharted island in the Caribbean where they encounter dangers and make remarkable discoveries, including the potential for treasure.  The opening of the novel introduces us to the boys aboard the yacht, particularly focusing on three friends: Billy Manners, Harry Dickson, and Jack Sheldon, as they react to the unfamiliar and tumultuous ocean waves. Their initial fears of seasickness dissolve into excitement as they sail toward adventure. A dramatic turn occurs when young Jesse W. Smith falls overboard, and Jack bravely jumps in to rescue him, confronting the danger of a nearby shark in the process. This daring act establishes Jack as a hero and sets the tone for their adventurous exploration of Lost Island, where they will navigate the mysteries and dangers that await them.
