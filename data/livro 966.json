    "resumo": "\"Wizard\" by Laurence M. Janifer is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. The story is set in a medieval-like world where telepathy exists but is hidden under the guise of a \"Masquerade\" to protect telepaths from persecution, particularly from an Inquisition. At its core, the book explores themes of identity, courage, and the struggle against oppressive authority.  The protagonist, Jonas, is a telepath who arrives in the town of Speyer with the intention of helping a family under threat from the Inquisition, represented by a ruthless Inquisitor named Knupf. As Jonas navigates this dangerous environment, he faces the challenge of proving his abilities without being considered a wizard, which would lead to his execution. The story unfolds as Jonas becomes entwined with the Scharpe family, who have suffered under the Inquisitor's regime. Through a series of cunning moves, he ultimately confronts Knupf, revealing the truth about his telepathy in a way that protects him and begins to dismantle the Inquisition's power in Speyer. The narrative blends elements of adventure and moral dilemmas, culminating in a significant step forward for the Brotherhood of telepaths that he represents.
