    "resumo": "\"Andor: Regény\" by Ferenc Molnár is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story seems to follow the character Andor, a young man navigating his responsibilities and relationships in Budapest, particularly in the context of significant changes in his life, the loss of his parents, and the complexities of young love.   The opening of the novel sets a somber and reflective tone as it introduces Andor during the early hours of dawn, crossing the Margit Bridge from Pest to Buda. Alone and tired, he contemplates the tranquility around him while grappling with his loneliness in the wake of his mother's death and his father's declining health. The narrative then shifts to Andor's home, where he reflects on his past, his relationships, particularly with Turnovszky Ella, and his impending move to a new apartment. As he prepares to leave his childhood home, the emotional weight of farewell looms large, underscored by memories of love, family tension, and the anxiety of stepping into adulthood. With layers of introspection and developing character dynamics, the beginning lays a strong foundation for the narrative's exploration of personal growth and the inevitabilities of life.
