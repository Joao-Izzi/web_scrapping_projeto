    "resumo": "\"The Vigil\" by W. W. Jacobs is a comedic short story written in the early 20th century. Set in a domestic environment, it explores themes of courage, familial expectations, and the humorous misunderstandings that arise from them. The narrative centers around the rivalry between Mr. Farrer, a timid yet determined suitor, and the authoritative ex-sergeant-major Ward, who disapproves of Farrer’s courting of his daughter and challenges him to prove his bravery.  The story unfolds as Mr. Farrer attempts to win the approval of Miss Ward’s overbearing father by daring to spend a night in a supposedly haunted cottage. The sergeant-major, hoping to expose Farrer’s cowardice, secretly follows him with a more frightening agenda, dressed in his wife's nightgown to frighten the young man. However, events take a comedic turn as Farrer, unbeknownst to the sergeant-major, encounters a series of strange occurrences that lead to escalating anxieties and misunderstandings. The climax reveals their amusing roles, ultimately highlighting the absurdity of their rivalry for the respect of one another, while also poking fun at the nature of bravado and the lengths one might go to for love.
