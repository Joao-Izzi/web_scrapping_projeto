    "resumo": "\"Excavations at the LoDaisKa Site in the Denver, Colorado area\" by H. J. and C. C. Irwin et al. is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. This work presents archaeological research focusing on the LoDaisKa site, examining various cultural remains and stratigraphic layers from the area around Morrison, Colorado. The book is likely to appeal to readers interested in archaeology, anthropology, and the historical cultures of the American West.  The opening of the book provides a detailed introduction to the background of the archaeological investigation at the LoDaisKa site, describing its geographical and cultural significance as a transitional area between two distinct cultures: the Desert Culture of the Great Basin and the Plains cultures. The authors acknowledge the contributions of various individuals, particularly Dr. H. M. Wormington, and highlight the significance of prior surveys leading to their excavation work. Furthermore, they introduce initial observations about the site's physiographical characteristics, including its climate and the flora and fauna of the region, setting the stage for a more in-depth exploration of the archaeological findings.
