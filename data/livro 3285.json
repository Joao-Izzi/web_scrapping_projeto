    "resumo": "\"The Mayflower Society House\" by Walter Merriam Pratt is a historical account written in the late 19th to early 20th century. The book delves into the significant history surrounding the Edward Winslow House in Plymouth, Massachusetts, as well as the broader narrative of the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower. It aims to commemorate the legacy and ideals of these early settlers in American history.  In the book, Pratt narrates the story of the Edward Winslow House, detailing its construction in 1754 and the historical figures associated with it, including Edward Winslow, a Royalist who supported the British Crown during the American Revolution. The narrative expands to cover the Pilgrims' journey, their hardships, and the founding of the Plymouth Colony, emphasizing key events like the signing of the Mayflower Compact—the first governing document of the new colony—which laid the groundwork for American democracy. Pratt provides a rich context for the Pilgrims' motivations for leaving England, their struggle for religious freedom, and the contributions that their experiences made to American ideals and government.
