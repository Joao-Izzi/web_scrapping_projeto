    "resumo": "\"Lilith: A Romance\" by George MacDonald is a fantasy novel likely written in the late 19th century. The story follows the journey of the protagonist, Mr. Vane, who has just concluded his studies at Oxford and is exploring themes of existence, the metaphysical, and the nature of reality as he interacts with strange figures such as a raven and his ethereal wife. As Vane grapples with the boundaries between different realms—symbolized by the ancient library and its haunted elements—he is drawn into an exploration of deeper truths about life and the self.  At the start of the novel, the main character, Mr. Vane, reflects on his isolation after losing his parents at a young age and his recent transition from the academic world to managing his estate. As he settles into a library filled with ancient texts, he experiences peculiar visions that suggest a haunting presence linked to his ancestor. The narrative quickly introduces a sense of mystery and enchantment as Vane encounters a shadowy figure known as Mr. Raven, whose strange interactions lead him to a deeper metaphysical journey. As Vane ventures through various spaces, including an eerie garret and a surreal cemetery, he begins questioning his identity, the nature of existence, and ultimately, his connection to both the living and the dead. The blend of fantasy and philosophical introspection sets the stage for a profound exploration of the human soul. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
