    "resumo": "\"The Transformation of Philip Jettan\" by Georgette Heyer is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds primarily in rural Sussex and revolves around the lives of the Jettan family and their acquaintances, especially focusing on the central character, Philip Jettan. The tale explores themes of social status, personal transformation, and romance, particularly addressing Philip's desire to win the heart of the beautiful Cleone Charteris while grappling with his unrefined nature, contrasted against the polished society around him.  The opening of the novel introduces the tranquil setting of Little Fittledean and the Jettan house, aptly named \"Jettan's Pride.\" We learn about the Jettan family dynamics through the humorous banter between Philip and his brother Thomas, as well as glimpses into their father's legacy and expectations. Early on, Philip's lack of fashionable refinement is established, setting the stage for his internal conflict as he desires both Cleone and societal acceptance. The narrative hints at the challenges he will face as he wrestles with his identity, which becomes even more pronounced with the introduction of the dashing Mr. Bancroft, who embodies the very elegance Philip strives to attain. This introduction makes it clear that the book will delve into Philip's journey of transformation within this comedic landscape of manners and aspirations.
