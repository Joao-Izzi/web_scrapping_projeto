    "resumo": "\"Noteworthy Records of Bats From Nicaragua, with a Checklist of the Chiropteran Fauna of the Country\" by J. Knox Jones Jr., James Dale Smith, and Ronald W. Turner is a scientific publication written in the early 1970s. This work provides valuable insights into the diversity and distribution of bat species in Nicaragua, documenting information on 40 bat species, including 14 recorded for the first time in the country. The authors utilize a systematic approach to catalog these species and their ecological contexts, contributing to the understanding of mammalian fauna in Central America.  The opening of the publication outlines the systematic recording of bat species based on specimens collected in Nicaragua primarily by field representatives of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas. It highlights the geographical significance of Nicaragua in relation to mammalian distribution and notes the gaps in scientific literature regarding the country's fauna. The initial sections detail the methodology of data collection and provide a checklist of the bat species throughout the document, indicating their respective localities and specific characteristics, thereby setting the foundation for the comprehensive accounts and observations found in the later chapters.
