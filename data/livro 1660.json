    "resumo": "\"The Little Review, November 1915 (Vol. 2, No. 8)\" by Various is a periodical literary magazine published during the early 20th century. This issue includes a collection of essays, literary critiques, and artworks, showcasing various facets of artistic expression including literature, drama, music, and art. The content reflects the cultural and social contexts of its time, addressing themes such as love, suffering, and the human experience in relation to the ongoing tumult of the World War.  The opening portion of the magazine features a poetic piece titled \"Life Itself\" by Margaret C. Anderson, which contemplates the complexities of human existence, centering on themes such as love, disillusionment, and the pursuit of self-understanding. Anderson explores a range of emotional states, from the longing for connection to encounters with lifeâ€™s inherent struggles. The transition into a reflective tone begins a discussion on the essence of life and the experiences that shape an artist's perception, evolving into a deeper philosophical exploration of identity and human connectivity. This opening sets the stage for a broader discussion within the volume about the state of art and literature amidst the chaos of the time. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
