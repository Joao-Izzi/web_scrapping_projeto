    "resumo": "\"An Unsocial Socialist\" by George Bernard Shaw is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story, infused with Shaw's signature wit and social commentary, revolves around the complexities of socialism and individualism, as depicted through a series of engaging interactions among its characters, primarily focusing on young women and their experiences in a college setting.   The opening of the novel introduces us to a serene October evening at an English country house, where Miss Wilson, a sensible woman, monitors the antics of her students, Miss Wylie, Miss Carpenter, and Miss Lindsay. The scene unfolds as the girls hastily descend the stairs amid laughter, creating a lively atmosphere that quickly turns to tension when Miss Wilson reprimands them for breaking the rules. Their playful exchanges transition into moments of conflict, touching on themes of rebellion and the struggle against authority. The interactions between the girls reflect their distinct personalities, setting the stage for further exploration of their relationships and the implications of social norms within the context of their education.
