The work features the posthumous writings of Josiah Abraham Lambkin, a Fellow of Burford College, and reflects on his life, thoughts, and the community of Oxford University. The collection's topics span from personal reflections to societal observations, hinting at Lambkin's character as a dedicated scholar and a deeply reflective individual.  The opening of \"Lambkin's Remains\" sets the stage for the life and intellectual contributions of Josiah Lambkin, introducing him as a significant, albeit underappreciated, figure in his academic context. It starts with a dedicatory ode that emphasizes the author's bond with his friends and their shared experiences in Oxford. Belloc's preface provides insight into Lambkin's modesty and the profound influence he had on those around him, highlighting anecdotes from his life as a scholar and educator. This initial portrayal establishes a warm, nostalgic tone, inviting readers to explore Lambkin's thoughts and the intricate web of friendships and societal commentary that permeate his works.
