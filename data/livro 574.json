    "resumo": "\"The Philosophy of the Practical: Economic and Ethic\" by Benedetto Croce is a philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century. This book explores the interrelationship and distinctions between practical activities and theoretical understanding, examining how both economic and ethical dimensions shape human actions. Croce delves into the nature of will and knowledge, arguing that true understanding transcends mere psychological classification and involves a deeper philosophical inquiry.  At the start of the work, Croce introduces the concept of practical activity as a unique form of spiritual expression, distinct from both theoretical thought and emotional feeling. He critiques the psychological methods that attempt to categorize human activities exclusively into practical or theoretical realms, asserting that all forms intertwine within the unified spirit of humanity. The beginning sets up a foundation for a more profound exploration of how economic and ethical actions are informed by theoretical frameworks while emphasizing the autonomy of practical thought as a critical component of human existence.
