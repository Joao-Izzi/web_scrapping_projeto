    "resumo": "\"The Doctor's Secret Journal\" by Daniel Morison is a historical account written in the late 18th century. This book contains the personal journal of Morison, who served as a surgeon's mate at Fort Michilimackinac between 1769 and 1772. The journal offers a vivid portrayal of the chaotic and often brutal life at a British outpost during this tumultuous period, covering topics such as military misconduct, personal conflicts, and the dreary realities of frontier living.  In the narrative, Daniel Morison recounts various events that occur within and around the fort, highlighting his fraught relationships with fellow officers, particularly Ensign Robert Johnson, who is depicted as a bully and a source of great distress for Morison. The journal details incidents of violence, including an assault on Morison himself, as well as broader issues such as corruption and lawlessness among the military personnel stationed at the fort. Through his observations, Morison shines a light on the struggles and injustices faced by those living in this challenging environment, resulting in a unique and often darkly humorous depiction of life on the frontier. The journal serves both as a reflection of personal grievances and a critical commentary on the abuses of power in military society. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
