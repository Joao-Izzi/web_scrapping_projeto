    "resumo": "\"The Grisly Horror\" by Robert E. Howard is a gripping tale of horror and heroism, presented as a short fiction piece that likely emerged in the early 20th century, specifically during the 1930s. The story unfolds in the dark, oppressive landscapes of the Mississippi swamps, centering around themes of ancient curses, grotesque entities, and the primal terror woven into the very fabric of the land. The narrative dives deep into the dark secrets of a family, the Ballvilles, and portrays the struggle between forces of evil and the resilient spirit of the protagonist.  The plot follows Bristol McGrath, a man drawn back to his ancestral homeland by a telegram claiming the love of his life, Constance Brand, still lives. As he ventures into the haunted territory of the Ballville estate, he encounters horrific sights, including the tortured remnants of Richard Ballville, Constance’s captor. McGrath’s quest leads him to uncover the nefarious plans of John De Albor, a man connected to an ancient cult worshiping a deadly entity, Zemba, a horrific creature reminiscent of a monstrous ape. The story crescendos into a frantic race against time as McGrath fights not only for Constance's safety but also battles the dark forces tied to the cursed history of the region, leading to a climactic confrontation against both De Albor and the monstrous Zemba. Ultimately, it encapsulates themes of love, vengeance, and the savage horrors that lie just beneath the surface of civilization. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
