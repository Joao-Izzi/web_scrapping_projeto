    "resumo": "\"East of the Shadows\" by Mrs. Hubert Barclay is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Philippa Harford, a young woman navigating her personal identity and relationships amidst deep themes of love and longing. As she travels to visit an old friend, her presence triggers a complex series of emotions and connections surrounding her past, particularly linked to a man named Francis Heathcote who has been waiting for a love lost long ago.  The opening of this narrative introduces Philippa as she embarks on a journey, reflecting on her upbringing and the loss of her father. A significant aspect of her character is revealed through her introspection and the contrast between her reserved nature and her motherâ€™s more carefree spirit. Upon her arrival at Bessacre, she encounters a mysterious man who believes her to be his long-lost love, thrusting her into a web of emotions tied to his history of heartache and attachment. This unexpected twist propels Philippa into a narrative fraught with themes of mistaken identity, unrequited love, and the burdens of the past, setting the stage for deeper exploration as the story unfolds.
