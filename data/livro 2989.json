    "resumo": "\"How It Flies; or, The Conquest of the Air\" by Richard Ferris is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work chronicles humanity's efforts to achieve mechanical flight, discussing the inventions that have enabled this ambition, such as aircraft and balloons. The book also explores the laws of flight, the development of various flying machines, and practical information on how to build and operate them.   The opening of the book sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of aeronautics by celebrating the realization of mankind's long-held dream to fly, particularly highlighted by significant developments in aviation that took place around 1908 with prominent figures like the Wright brothers and Santos-Dumont. Ferris acknowledges the importance of the gasoline engine in these advancements and expresses a desire to share fundamental concepts such as the properties of air and the principles governing flight. He lays the groundwork for understanding aeronautics, indicating that subsequent chapters will delve into detailed discussions of flying machines, their designs, and operational mechanics, all while making the complex subject accessible to a general audience.
