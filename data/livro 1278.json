    "resumo": "\"Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal\" is a historical account written in the late 20th century documenting the Nuremberg Trials that took place between 1945 and 1946. This volume presents the official proceedings of the International Military Tribunal, focusing on various sessions that addressed the actions and policies implemented by the Nazi regime during World War II, with a particular emphasis on economic spoliation and the treatment of occupied countries such as Belgium and Luxembourg.  The opening of the volume introduces the context of the trials, highlighting the prosecution's initial arguments regarding the economic exploitation of occupied territories during the German occupation. In particular, it details how the Nazis systematically stripped resources from Belgium, employing various methods to control and exploit its economy for their war efforts. The prosecutor outlines the planned and deliberate actions against the Belgian production capabilities and notes the detrimental impact on the local population and economy, setting the stage for a broader examination of war crimes and their consequences as presented throughout the trial.
