    "resumo": "\"In the Russian Ranks: A Soldier's Account of the Fighting in Poland\" by John Morse is a historical account written during the early 20th century. The book chronicles the experiences of an Englishman serving in the Russian army during the tumultuous events of World War I, specifically focusing on the conflict occurring in Poland. The narrative captures the brutality of war and the human experiences of those caught in its chaos.  The opening of the book sets the stage for the author's personal journey into a world engulfed by the Great War. Starting in July 1914, he describes his initial innocence about the war as he travels through Germany just before the conflict erupts. He witnesses the mobilization of German troops and the atmosphere of impending doom, ultimately leading to his hasty retreat toward Kalisz in Poland as war declarations unfold. As he arrives in Kalisz, he is confronted with the horrors committed by the German soldiers before a shot had been fired between the opposing armies, showcasing the atrocities and madness that often accompany warfare. Through Morse's eyes, the reader gets a visceral glimpse into the chaos and moral decay that permeate the battlefield, foreshadowing the extensive narrative of his experiences with the Russian army.
