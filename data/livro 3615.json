    "resumo": "\"The Bronze Eagle: A Story of the Hundred Days\" by Baroness Emmuska Orczy is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set in the dramatic period surrounding Napoleon Bonaparte's return from exile, the book explores themes of loyalty, politics, and personal ambition against the backdrop of impending conflict. The narrative likely follows characters such as Victor de Marmont, an ardent Bonapartist, and his English friend Bobby Clyffurde, as they navigate the complexities of their allegiances and aspirations during this tumultuous time in French history.  The opening of the novel sets a vivid scene as a ship approaches the shores of France, heralding the return of the Emperor. The fishermen and laborers gather in anticipation, revealing a blend of skepticism and excitement about the Emperor's reappearance. As the narrative progresses, de Marmont's fervent enthusiasm for Napoleon contrasts sharply with the pragmatic views of Clyffurde, who observes the political ramifications of Bonaparte's return. Amidst this backdrop, the friends engage in discussions about loyalty, national identity, and the looming threats to peace, hinting at personal stakes and broader societal dilemmas that are emblematic of the era. The drama is enhanced by the introspective thoughts of Crystal de Cambray, who faces conflicts of duty and desire as her life becomes entwined with royalist ambitions.
