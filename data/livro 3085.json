    "resumo": "\"Interim: Pilgrimage, Volume 5\" by Dorothy M. Richardson is a novel written in the early 20th century. This work continues the narrative of the protagonist, Miriam Henderson, exploring themes of identity, personal growth, and the complexities of social interactions, particularly within the backdrop of London life. The book delves into Miriam's introspections and experiences as she navigates her relationships and societal expectations while seeking a sense of belonging and self-understanding.  The opening of \"Interim\" introduces readers to Miriam's arrival at the home of the Brooms, capturing her feelings of relief and welcome contrasted with her underlying sense of grubbiness from travel. The scene is vibrant with intimate conversations and preparations for supper, highlighting the warmth of familial interactions amid the dampness of a winter evening. Miriamâ€™s reflections reveal a profound appreciation for the comfort she finds in this setting, intertwined with her ambivalence about her place within the group and her broader existence. As she engages with the Brooms and their social dynamics, she simultaneously grapples with her internal struggles and desires for connection, setting the stage for her continued journey of self-discovery throughout the novel.
