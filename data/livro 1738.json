    "resumo": "\"Dunamelléki eredeti népmesék (2. kötet)\" by László Merényi is a collection of original folk tales compiled in the mid-19th century. The book presents a variety of endearing stories featuring different characters, including merchants, kings, and humble men, all of whom encounter whimsical adventures and magical creatures. Through these narratives, the book explores themes of kindness, cleverness, and the transformative power of humility.  The opening of this volume introduces several characters who find themselves lost in a thick forest: a merchant, a king, and a poor man. Each of them, after days of wandering, cries out for help, and they are each aided by a small hedgehog that promises to lead them out of the forest in exchange for a reward. The merchant and the king both offer their daughters and money, while the poor man offers to adopt the hedgehog as his son. The narrative sets a fairy-tale tone, revealing the importance of promises and the potential for redemption, leading to a rich tale of unexpected alliances and rewards that unfolds as the hedgehog assists each character.
