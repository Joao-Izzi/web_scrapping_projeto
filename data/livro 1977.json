    "resumo": "\"Twelfth Night; or, What You Will\" by William Shakespeare is a comedy written in the early 17th century. The play explores themes of love, identity, and the complexities of human relationships through a series of humorous situations and mistaken identities. Central to the story is Viola, a shipwrecked woman who disguises herself as a man named Cesario, leading to a web of romantic entanglements involving Duke Orsino, who loves Olivia, and Olivia, who falls for Cesario.  At the start of the play, we are introduced to Viola, who has washed ashore in the land of Illyria after a shipwreck. Concerned for her twin brother Sebastian, whom she believes to be dead, she decides to disguise herself as a young man to navigate her new surroundings. As she searches for safety and purpose, we learn about the Duke Orsino, who is lovesick over Olivia, a noblewoman mourning her brother's death, leading to her refusal of suitors. The opening sets the stage for a comedic exploration of love and deception, hinting at the unfolding chaos that will stem from Viola's disguise and the overlapping affections of all characters involved.
