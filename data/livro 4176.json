    "resumo": "\"Frye's Practical Candy Maker\" by George V. Frye is a practical guide on confectionery, written in the late 19th century. This work serves as a comprehensive resource for candy makers, providing a wealth of recipes specifically designed for the manufacture of fine, hand-made candies, catering particularly to those in the retail trade. The focus is on enabling confectioners to produce high-quality sweets without the need for skilled labor, making it crucial for small businesses striving to attract customers with appealing candy displays.  The opening of the book sets the stage for its instructional content, highlighting the author's intent to deliver practical, straightforward recipes rather than elaborate theorizing about confectionery. Frye emphasizes the importance of quality materials, like sugar, and outlines the fundamental techniques necessary for successful candy making, such as boiling degrees and the proper use of flavorings and colors. He addresses the realities faced by confectioners during his time, particularly small-scale operators, and expresses hope that his collected knowledge will empower them to enhance their offerings and thrive in their trade.
