    "resumo": "\"The Psychology of the Poet Shelley\" by Edward Carpenter and George Christian Barnard is a critical study written in the early 20th century. This work delves into the psychological aspects of the renowned Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, examining his complex nature through the lens of modern psychology, particularly focusing on his emotional and sexual inclinations. The text seeks to illuminate Shelley's character by analyzing the profound influences of love, desire, and emotional turmoil that permeate his poetry.  The opening of the book introduces the need to revisit and analyze Shelley's psychology in line with contemporary theories of sex and emotional depth. Carpenter discusses the typical observations made about Shelley's personality—his feminine traits, idealized views of love, and the interplay of masculinity and femininity in his character. Emphasizing the significance of these observations, Carpenter critiques prior literary analyses for neglecting to explore these aspects cohesively. The introduction sets the stage for a detailed examination of how Shelley’s experiences and interpersonal relationships shaped his art and highlights the intricate connection between his mental state and his poetic expressions.
