    "resumo": "\"Useful Knowledge: Volume 3. Animals\" by William Bingley is a scientific publication written in the early 19th century. This volume is part of a larger work that provides a comprehensive overview of the animal kingdom, focusing on various species, their classifications, and their significance to human life. This work aims to serve as both an informative guide and a reference for readers interested in zoology and the utility of animals in human affairs.  The opening of the book establishes a foundational understanding of zoology and introduces various classifications of animals, such as Mammalia, Birds, Amphibia, Fishes, Insects, and Worms. It emphasizes the characteristics that define each class, delves into the specific orders within Mammalia, and discusses the utility of different animals to humansâ€”from food sources to materials used for clothing and tools. In particular, the text highlights the relevance of understanding animal physiology and behavior, setting the stage for deeper exploration of specific species in subsequent chapters.
