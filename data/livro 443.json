    "resumo": "\"Rough and Tumble Engineering\" by James H. Maggard is a practical guide to operating farm and traction engines, likely written in the early 20th century. The book focuses on providing hands-on advice and techniques for inexperienced engineers, emphasizing the importance of common sense and practical knowledge over strict scientific principles. Maggard draws from his own experiences, aiming to equip readers with the skills necessary to handle engines effectively, troubleshoot common problems, and ensure safe operations.  The opening of the text introduces readers to the author's intent and style, stressing the non-scientific, practical nature of the guidance provided. Maggard encourages readers, particularly young men eager to become adept engineers, to engage actively in learning and applying the skills discussed. He outlines the basics of ensuring an engine is in good running order, detailing how to start it, monitor its components, and prevent issues such as overheating. The emphasis is on observing and attending to the engine thoughtfully, instilling a sense of responsibility and diligence required for a competent engineer. The preface and introductory sections set the tone for a hands-on, approachable manual that prioritizes practical knowledge necessary for running engines successfully.
