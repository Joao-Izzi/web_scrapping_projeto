    "resumo": "\"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776\" by S. A. Reilly is a historical account written in the early 21st century. The book examines the evolution of English law from the time of King AEthelbert up to 1776, highlighting significant legal developments and their societal implications. It covers foundational aspects such as the origins of common law, the jury system, and key events like the signing of the Magna Carta, providing a lens through which readers can understand the lasting impact of these laws on modern society.  The opening of this work introduces the purpose and structure of the text, explaining its aim to provide an appreciation of historical legal frameworks that have contributed to societal stability. It establishes a foundational context for the ensuing chapters by outlining the evolution of laws and legal practices, from early Anglo-Saxon norms to the more structured legal systems that would follow. The text is presented in three sections for each chapter: \"The Times\" to provide historical context, \"The Law\" detailing specific legal statutes, and \"Judicial Procedure\" to explain how laws were applied and adjudicated in practice. This organized approach prepares the reader for a thorough exploration of the development of English legal heritage. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
