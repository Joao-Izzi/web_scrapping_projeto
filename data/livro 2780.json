    "resumo": "\"What Is Art?\" by Leo Tolstoy is a philosophical treatise that wrestles with the meaning and value of art, written in the late 19th century. In this work, Tolstoy examines how art functions within society, particularly its moral implications, and questions whether it serves the true emotional and spiritual needs of mankind. The text probes the distinctions between various forms of art and discusses the role that art should play in our lives, aiming to characterize art as a human activity that impacts communal feelings and ethical progress.  At the start of the book, Tolstoy raises significant questions regarding the nature and purpose of art, arguing that much of what is traditionally accepted as art may be superficial or harmful. He reflects on his personal experiences and observations of the art world, including a poignant critique of the artistic process behind operations like opera rehearsals, illustrating the often dehumanizing labor involved. He challenges readers to reconsider the definitions and criteria of art and to understand it as a means for emotional connection and societal betterment, rather than self-indulgence or elitism. Through these reflections, he sets the tone for a thorough investigation into what constitutes genuine art and how it aligns with the betterment of humanity.
