    "resumo": "\"When 'Bear Cat' Went Dry\" by Charles Neville Buck is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in the Appalachian region and follows the tumultuous relationship between Turner Stacy, nicknamed Bear Cat, and his father, Lone Stacy, who engages in illegal moonshining as a means of survival.

The opening of the novel introduces us to the Stacy family, with Lone Stacy's stern demeanor contrasting sharply with the aspirations of his son, Turner. As he searches for his missing son, Lone expresses frustration with Turnerâ€™s reluctance to assist with their moonshining operation. We learn that Turner, though physically strong, wrestles with an inner conflict related to his identity and a burgeoning desire for a better life.
