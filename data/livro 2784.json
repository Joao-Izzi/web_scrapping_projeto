    "resumo": "\"Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism\" by Thomas Inman, M.D. and John Newton is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work explores the connections between pagan symbolism and Christian iconography, examining how ancient symbols have influenced modern religious practices and beliefs. The authors aim to illuminate the often-overlooked ties between ancient pagan customs and later Christian traditions.  At the start of the volume, the authors lay the groundwork for their exploration of symbolism by emphasizing the significance of symbols in religion and the distinct meanings attributed to them across different cultures. They discuss the historical context of religious practices and the various interpretations of symbols used in both paganism and Christianity. This introduction sets the stage for a detailed examination of specific symbols, indicating that the exploration will include both visual emblems and their underlying meanings, as well as how these concepts have persisted and evolved through time.
