    "resumo": "\"Der Weltkrieg, III. Band\" by Karl Helfferich is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the complex events of World War I, particularly focusing on the ramifications of America's intervention and the subsequent events leading up to the collapse of the Central Powers. It outlines key developments such as the U-boat warfare, the impact of the Russian Revolution, and the political dynamics between Germany and Austria-Hungary.  The opening of the book introduces readers to Helfferich's perspective on the war's unfolding, where he reflects on the momentous decisions and actions that characterized this global conflict. He emphasizes the significance of America's entry into the war and how it altered the balance of power, turning it into a true world conflict. The text also touches on various national responses, detailing how neutral countries navigated their positions amidst the growing tensions, as well as exploring the internal struggles within Austria-Hungary and Russia that further complicated the war. Through these lenses, Helfferich aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of these events on Germany and the larger war effort. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
