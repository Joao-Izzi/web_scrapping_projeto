    "resumo": "\"Thirsty Blades\" by Otis Adelbert Kline and E. Hoffmann Price is a fantasy adventure novel written during the early 20th century. The book follows the character Saidi Rankin, who embarks on a quest entwined with themes of reincarnation, ancient promises, and dark forces that are tied to a mythical narrative surrounding the legendary King Solomon.   In the narrative, Rankin, known in his past life as Abdemon, seeks to fulfill a promise made to him by Solomon regarding his beloved, Azizah. The story unfolds as he battles against Iblis, the Dark Prince, during the night of the 14th of Nisan. Rankin confronts various adversaries, including devout devil-worshipers led by Zantut, who aim to harness the power of Iblis. Amidst the backdrop of the mystical and perilous landscapes of Kurdistan, Rankin's path is fraught with intense sword combats, supernatural elements, and vibrant characters. The climax centers on a dramatic combat duel between Rankin and Iblis, with the fate of his love and his past hanging in the balance, thereby embracing classic themes of good versus evil in a richly textured mythological setting.
