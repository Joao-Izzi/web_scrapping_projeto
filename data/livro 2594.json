    "resumo": "\"A gondolkodók és egyéb elbeszélések\" by Margit Kaffka is a collection of stories written in the early 20th century. The opening portion introduces two students with fiery imaginations – a boy and a girl – who meet for the first time in Budapest. The narrative explores themes of youth, love, and existential questioning against the backdrop of their burgeoning relationship.  At the start of the narrative, we meet the young girl, who has just arrived in the city and harbors fears shaped by her past experiences. In contrast, the boy is more worldly but grapples with the chaotic nature of life. Their initial encounter happens under seemingly unconnected circumstances – he, returning from a rowing race, and she, coming from a church. As they begin to meet frequently, a dynamic of innocent flirtation interwoven with deeper reflections about life and love develops. The tension between their emerging feelings and their intellectual conversations highlights their individual attempts to understand themselves and one another, setting the stage for a complex exploration of relationships and identity.
