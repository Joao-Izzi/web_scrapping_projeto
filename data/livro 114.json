    "resumo": "\"The Canadian\" by D. Torbett and W. Somerset Maugham is a novelization of Maugham's play, likely written in the early 20th century. The narrative primarily follows Nora Marsh, a young woman who has spent ten years as a companion to the demanding Miss Wickham and is now facing the uncertainty of her future after her employer's death. As she contemplates her past and the dreams she once held, including traveling and finding love, Nora grapples with the fallout of being left penniless, ultimately leading her to make significant choices about her new life.  At the start of the book, Nora awakens to a sense of physical and mental relief after a period of exhaustion following Miss Wickham's death. As she reflects on her decade-long stint as the old woman's companion, her memories reveal a complex mix of resentment and understanding toward Miss Wickham, highlighting the sacrifices she made for the promise of a better life. With the funeral approaching and her future looking bleak, Nora receives news of her legacy, prompting her to dream about travel and independenceâ€”longing for the freedom she has never truly experienced. The opening chapters set the stage for her emotional journey, revealing her internal struggles and the societal confines she must navigate in seeking a new identity amidst loss and change.
