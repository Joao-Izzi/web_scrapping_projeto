    "resumo": "\"Narrative and Critical History of America, Vol. 2\" by Justin Winsor is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This volume focuses primarily on the Spanish explorations and settlements in America from the 15th to the 17th centuries, providing a critical examination of the documentary sources that capture these pivotal moments in history. The book aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding the Spanish conquests and their impact on both the indigenous populations and European powers.  The opening of this volume begins with an introduction that outlines the importance of documentary evidence in studying early Spanish-American history, highlighting initial efforts to compile historical accounts and archives. It discusses previous historians, such as Herrera, and the challenges of accessing original documents. This sets the stage for an exploration of Christopher Columbus and his consequential voyages, detailing his early life, aspirations, and interactions with influential figures that would lead to his expedition in 1492. This section serves as a foundation for understanding the broader themes of exploration and colonization that are further explored throughout the volume.
