    "resumo": "\"The Wave of Scepticism and the Rock of Truth\" by M. H. Habershon is a theological critique written in the late 19th century. This work serves as a response to the challenges posed by German anti-Christian literature, particularly an inquiry into the reality of divine revelation. The author aims to provide a robust defense of Christianity, emphasizing the historical credibility of the Gospels and affirming the reality of miracles as fundamental to the faith.  The opening of the text outlines the author's intent to counteract the influence of skepticism surrounding Christianity. Habershon introduces his arguments in the preface, indicating that the work originated from a previous essay presented to the Young Men's Society. He seeks to engage both young men and older individuals who may be struggling with doubts about their faith, urging them to confront the anti-Christian narratives head-on. Through detailed analysis and rebuttal of various criticisms, particularly concerning miracles and the validity of the Gospels, Habershon establishes the groundwork for a comprehensive defense of Christian doctrine that is meant to reassure believers and challenge skeptics alike.
