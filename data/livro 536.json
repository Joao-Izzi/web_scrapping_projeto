    "resumo": "\"Un tuteur embarrassé\" by Roger Dombre is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around Odette d'Héristel, a spirited young girl who finds herself in the peculiar predicament of being mourned as dead by her family and loved ones, despite being in a state of lethargy rather than actual death. This unusual situation sets the stage for a comedic exploration of her character and relationships, particularly with her protective cousin Robert and her eccentric guardians.  The opening of the narrative introduces readers to Odette's experience of what she believes to be her own death, expressed through her witty and insightful internal dialogue. As her family mournfully discusses her passing, Odette, still conscious, observes their reactions with a mix of amusement and melancholy. The chaos of the scene is compounded by her vivid recollections, thoughts of wealth, and concerns regarding her relationships with family members, particularly Robert, who seems to occupy a significant place in her heart. This intriguing blend of humor and introspection invites readers to engage deeply with the unfolding events that will explore themes of youth, mortality, and family dynamics.
