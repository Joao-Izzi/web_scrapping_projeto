    "resumo": "\"Doctor Jolliffe's Boys\" by Lewis Hough is a historical novel set in a boys' boarding school during the late 19th century. The story revolves around the experiences and relationships of the students, particularly focusing on the tensions and rivalries that arise amidst their youthful antics, including cricket games and clandestine adventures. The narrative is rich in detail and vividly captures the spirited lives of the boys as they navigate the challenges of adolescence.  The opening portion of the novel introduces us to an exciting cricket match between Weston School and Hillsborough that sets the stage for rivalry among the boys. We meet the ambitious Saurin, who is determined to prove himself on the field, and Crawley, who is portrayed as a skilled and confident captain. Tensions escalate as Saurin grapples with feelings of jealousy and resentment towards Crawley, culminating in their first conflict that implies deeper animosities. This section effectively establishes character dynamics, the competitive atmosphere of school life, and foreshadows a confrontation that reflects the underlying themes of pride and ambition within the boarding school setting.
