This book serves as a comforting companion for those who are unwell, unable to sleep, or simply fatigued, aiming to uplift spirits with a diverse range of joyful texts. Through its selection of comforting pieces, the book seeks to create an atmosphere of happiness and distraction, inviting readers to immerse themselves in a world of light-heartedness.  The opening portion of the book sets the tone for its purpose, as Begbie introduces the concept of a \"Bed-Book\" dedicated to happiness. He explores the idea of maintaining a positive outlook, especially during times of physical weakness, and shares anecdotes from his experiences caring for a sick child. Highlighting the challenge of finding suitable reading material that uplifts without disheartening the ill, Begbie explains his aspiration to create a compilation that is entirely devoid of sadness or gloom. This introductory segment effectively conveys the author's intention to provide solace through a treasury of cheerful writings, ensuring that readers may find joy, comfort, and a sense of companionship in the midst of adversity.
