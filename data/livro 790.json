    "resumo": "\"St. Peter's Umbrella: A Novel\" by Kálmán Mikszáth is a work of fiction written in the late 19th century, characterized by its rich storytelling and satirical exploration of rural Hungarian life. The narrative centers around the orphaned child, little Veronica, and her older brother, Father János, as they navigate the challenges of their impoverished existence in the village of Glogova. At the core of the story is a seemingly magical red umbrella, which becomes a pivotal symbol of blessings, misfortunes, and the intertwining fate of the villagers.  At the start of the novel, the narrative introduces us to Veronica, a two-year-old girl left orphaned after her schoolmaster mother’s death, and her struggles in a village rife with poverty. Following her mother’s funeral, Veronica is taken to live with her brother, János, a newly appointed priest. The story unfolds in the setting of Glogova, portraying the dismal environment and the strange sense of camaraderie within the community. As János grapples with his newfound responsibilities and the mysteries surrounding the arrival of the red umbrella—claimed by some to be a divine gift—Mikszáth weaves a tale rich in humor, superstition, and the human condition, hinting at larger themes such as fate, community, and the absurdities of life.
