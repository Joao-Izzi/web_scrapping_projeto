    "resumo": "\"Mrs. Warren's Daughter: A Story of the Woman's Movement\" by Sir Harry Johnston is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book serves as a sequel to George Bernard Shaw's \"Mrs. Warren's Profession,\" continuing the story of Vivien Warren and her mother, Catherine Warren, against the backdrop of the women's movement in England. It explores themes of gender equality, social expectations, and personal identity through the main character Vivien, who grapples with her unconventional upbringing and her ambition to forge her own path.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Vivien Warren, who runs an actuarial firm with her partner Honoria Fraser. Set in June 1900, the narrative reveals Vivien's internal conflicts as she reads a marriage proposal from her past lover, Frank Gardner, while contemplating her independence and career ambitions. As she interacts with Honoria, they discuss societal issues, their firm, and their plan to assist women in achieving financial independence and career opportunities. Vivien expresses a desire to escape her mother's controversial past and reveal her intentions to pursue law as David Vavasour Williams, a disguise she hopes will allow her to bypass the barriers women face in their professions. Overall, the opening establishes a rich context for issues of identity and ambition within the framework of the women's rights movement. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
