    "resumo": "\"The Hidden Places\" by Bertrand W. Sinclair is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Robert Hollister, a war veteran who has returned home disfigured and grappling with his new identity in a society that shuns him. As he seeks to rebuild his life, the narrative explores themes of isolation, lost love, and the struggle for acceptance.  At the start of the novel, Hollister is engulfed in despair, reflecting on his past while confronting the stark changes in his life following World War I. His disfigurement troubles him greatly, evoking feelings of alienation and abandonment, especially after discovering that his wife, Myra, has moved on to another life without him. The opening chapters vividly illustrate his psychological torment, showcasing his inner conflicts as he navigates his memories of the war, the loss of his wife, and the harsh realities of a changed world. As Hollister journeys into the wilderness of British Columbia, he contemplates not only the physical challenges before him but also the emotional turmoil stemming from his past and his desperate want for connection.
