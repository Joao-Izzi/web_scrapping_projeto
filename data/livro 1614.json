    "resumo": "\"A Chautauqua Idyl\" by Grace Livingston Hill is a narrative written in the late 19th century that falls under the category of a philosophical allegory. The book centers around the Chautauqua movement, highlighting themes of education, spirituality, and community. It weaves a story through the perspectives of various flower and animal characters who discuss their desire for gathering and learning in a celebratory way that honors their creator.  In the story, a group of flowers and creatures living near a brook yearn for something meaningful to do, leading to the idea of creating a Chautauqua gathering. They talk about the experiences of a new arrival, a bachelor button, who shares tales of a beautiful place where people come together to study and sing about God and nature. As they debate what their own Chautauqua should consist of, they explore topics such as theology, literature, and art. Each character brings their own unique contributions to the committee planning their event, culminating in a hopeful undertaking designed to celebrate their existence and the beauty of God's creation. The narrative illustrates the joy of collaboration, the importance of knowledge, and the power of collective praise. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
