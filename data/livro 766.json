    "resumo": "\"English Critical Essays: Nineteenth Century\" by Edmund D. Jones is a collection of essays focusing on English literary criticism from the 19th century. This compilation reflects the significant evolution of critical thought during that period, particularly emphasizing the transition from Neo-classical traditions toward Romantic principles in poetry and literary expression. A central theme includes the exploration of poetry's purpose, language, and its connection to emotion and nature.  The opening of this work features a preface explaining its objectives in compiling critical essays that illustrate the landscape of literary thought during the 19th century. It highlights the importance of the Romantic Movement, sparked by key events like the publication of \"Lyrical Ballads,\" and introduces prominent figures such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The essays included aim to discuss general principles of literary criticism rather than focus on specific authors or texts, with an intention to represent critiques of poetry's language and forms. Thus, this collection serves as both an anthology of 19th-century critical thought and a commentary on the changing nature of literature itself. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
