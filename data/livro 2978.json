    "resumo": "\"Histoire comique\" by Anatole France is a novel written in the late 19th century. Set in the theatrical world of Paris, the story revolves around Félicie Nanteuil, a young actress, and her interactions with various characters, including the doctor Trublet, and fellow actors, as well as her romantic entanglements, particularly with Robert de Ligny. The narrative seems to delve into themes of love, ambition, and the absurdities of theater life, all entwined with a comedic tone.  The beginning of \"Histoire comique\" introduces us to Félicie Nanteuil in her dressing room at the Odéon theater, preparing for a performance. She engages in vivid conversations with her dresser, Madame Michon, and the playwright Dr. Trublet about her sudden health issues and the nature of beauty, particularly discussing the societal constraints on women's bodies, such as corsets. As they converse, a young gentleman, Robert de Ligny, enters, further complicating the dynamics of Félicie's relationships. Through lighthearted banter and philosophical musings, the opening sets a playful yet reflective tone, hinting at the emotional and romantic conflicts that will unfold as the story progresses.
