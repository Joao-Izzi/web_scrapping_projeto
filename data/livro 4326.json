    "resumo": "\"The Rise and Fall of Prohibition\" by Charles Hanson Towne is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book examines the impact of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act on American society, highlighting the unexpected consequences and complexities of Prohibition. Towne delves into the cultural and social tensions related to restrictions on alcohol, emphasizing the ways in which they have reshaped behavior and attitudes among citizens.  The opening of the work introduces the perplexing nature of Prohibition, describing how it caught the American public by surprise despite the long-standing efforts of temperance advocates. Towne reflects on the irony of voters dismissing Prohibition as a mere joke only to find it thrust upon them as law. He critiques the shift in national attitude towards alcohol, arguing that Prohibition has created a culture of lawlessness and hypocrisy, where violation of laws has become commonplace, and presents a call to recognize the discontent brewing in society. The author sets the stage for a deeper exploration of these themes as he discusses the contradictions and absurdities surrounding the enforcement of Prohibition laws.
