    "resumo": "\"The Secrets of the Self (Asrár-i Khudi)\" by Sheikh Muhammad Iqbal is a philosophical poem written in the early 20th century. The work explores the profound theme of selfhood, emphasizing the significance of individual identity and self-affirmation in the broader context of existence. Iqbal's poetry acts as an exploration of the nature of the self and its relationship with love, desire, and the universe, presenting a blend of philosophical thought and poetic imagery.  At the start of the poem, the narrator embarks upon a profound journey of self-discovery, expressing the idea that true existence originates from the self and that life's essence is tied to the manifestation of one's own desires. The prologue sets a tone of awakening, with the narrator proclaiming a new identity and calling for action and self-assertion. Through vivid metaphors and evocative language, Iqbal grapples with concepts like individuality, the burdens of existence, and the power of love to enrich and sustain the self. The poem ultimately encourages readers to recognize their potential and to strive for personal growth and understanding in the quest for fulfillment. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
