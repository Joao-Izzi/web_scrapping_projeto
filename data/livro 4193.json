    "resumo": "\"When the Sun Went Out\" by Leslie F. Stone is a science fiction novel likely written in the late 1920s. The story unfolds in a dystopian future where Earth is on the brink of catastrophe as its sun is dying, plunging the planet into inevitable darkness. The narrative revolves around themes of survival, the decline of civilization, and humanity's struggle against nature.  The plot centers on Kuila Rei, an astronomer who witnesses the dying moments of the sun alongside a diminishing population grappling with their fate. As the characters navigate their desolate world, they work toward escaping the cold and dark by digging deep beneath the Earth's surface. Kuila forms a connection with Ramo Rei, a fellow astronomer, and together they explore the possibility of leaving their dying world for a new one. Throughout the story, the pursuit of knowledge, hope, and human connection persists even as the sun's last flickers signal the end of an era. Ultimately, the novel concludes with the sun's final demise, leaving the characters faced with a new life underground, yet holding onto the hope of someday finding a new sun and a rebirth of their civilization.
