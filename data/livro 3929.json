At the start of this work, we are introduced to the origins of King Arthur, detailing his secretive upbringing and eventual rise to kingship after pulling the sword from the stone. The narrative reveals how Arthur, initially unaware of his royal blood, is chosen by divine providence to unite the kingdom after the death of Uther Pendragon.
