    "resumo": "\"Null-ABC\" by H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire is a science fiction novel written in the early 1950s. The narrative unfolds in a futuristic society where literacy is a privilege restricted to a few, referred to as Literates, while the majority refer to themselves as Illiterates. Central to the story is Chester Pelton, a senator running a campaign against the influence of the Literates, as he grapples with both personal and political challenges surrounding his family, particularly his children, Claire and Ray, who possess the skills that threaten to upend their father's aspirations and societal norms.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Chester Pelton, enjoying breakfast with his children, Claire and Ray. The scene is set in a household where authentic food is a sign of affluence amidst a backdrop of socio-political tension. The narrative shifts from breakfast discussions to the political climate, as Chester is alerted to his son's admiration for a Literateâ€”a concern that festers amidst ongoing election campaigns. A heart attack incident involving Chester, triggered by a confrontation with a Literate, intensifies the stakes, highlighting the societal divide. The opening suggests a deep exploration of the ramifications of literacy on personal identity and power dynamics, foreshadowing a critical conflict that questions the role of educated elite in society.
