    "resumo": "\"The Making of a Trade School\" by Mary Schenck Woolman is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work chronicles the establishment and development of the Manhattan Trade School for Girls, the first of its kind in America, which was initiated to provide vocational training to young women in the workforce. The book addresses the school's founding principles, objectives, and the socio-economic conditions faced by its students, aiming to empower them with the skills necessary for stable employment and improved living conditions.  The opening of the book provides an overview of the early days of the Manhattan Trade School, beginning with its inception in 1902. It describes the urgent need for such an institution, driven by the struggles of young working women in New York City, who often entered the labor force unprepared and underpaid. Woolman outlines the original mission of the school to equip these girls with practical skills in various trades, including dressmaking and machine operation, while emphasizing the importance of a supportive educational environment. The narrative captures the schoolâ€™s growth from accommodating 20 pupils to eventually training hundreds, illustrating the challenges and successes faced in providing vocational education to a demographic striving for economic independence.
