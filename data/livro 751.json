    "resumo": "\"The History of Roman Literature\" by Charles Thomas Cruttwell is a historical account written in the late 19th century, focusing specifically on the development of Roman literature from its earliest forms to the death of Marcus Aurelius. This work serves as an insightful guide for students and general readers interested in exploring the rich literary tradition of Rome, including its connections to Greek influences and the evolution of various genres.  At the start of the book, Cruttwell establishes the scope and significance of Roman literature while addressing its early historical context. The introduction discusses the lack of poetic expression in early Rome, linking it to the practical nature of the Romans and their distinctly utilitarian approach to life, leading to a limited literary output prior to the influence of Greek culture. The author outlines the various periods of Roman literature, suggesting that while there were some rudimentary forms of poetry and drama, the true flowering of literary articulation began as the Romans encountered Greek literary traditions. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Roman authors and their works, emphasizing the gradual shift from a primarily utilitarian form of expression to a more sophisticated literary culture.
