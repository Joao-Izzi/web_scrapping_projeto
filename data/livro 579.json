    "resumo": "\"Mary, Help of Christians, and the Fourteen Saints Invoked as Holy Helpers\" compiled by Rev. Bonaventure Hammer, O.F.M. is a religious text that draws upon Catholic doctrine and traditions, likely written in the early 20th century. The book serves as a guide for devotion, featuring a compilation of novenas, prayers, and legends related to the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the fourteen saints recognized in Catholic tradition as intercessors. It emphasizes the significance of invoking these saints for various needs and spiritual support.  The opening portion introduces the theme of the veneration of saints, particularly focusing on the importance of Mary as \"Help of Christians.\" It outlines the efficacy of prayer and the role of saints as intercessors who can bring believers closer to God. Specifically, the text begins by articulating the Catholic teaching on the invocation of saints and emphasizes the connection between the faithful on earth and saints in heaven, underscoring how believers can seek their intercession for support in overcoming life's challenges. The chapters provide reflections on individual saints and the practices of prayer that enable a deeper relationship with both Mary and other holy figures, each serving as a guide for personal devotion.
