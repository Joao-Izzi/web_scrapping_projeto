    "resumo": "\"Subversive\" by Mack Reynolds is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. The book explores themes of economic disparity and anti-establishment sentiments, portraying a future world where basic commodities, like soap, are sold at inexplicably low prices through a secretive organization aiming to subvert the current socio-economic order. This narrative delves into the implications of undercutting established markets and the possible consequences on employment and the economy as a whole.  The story centers around Warren Dickens, a young soap salesman, who introduces a brand of nameless soap sold for merely three cents a bar by cutting out middlemen and traditional advertising. This unconventional business model garners the attention of Frank Tracy, an operative from the Bureau of Economic Subversion, who begins investigating Dickens and his employer, Freer Enterprises. As Tracy delves deeper, he uncovers a plot led by Moncure, the head of Freer Enterprises, who intends to not only sell soap but eventually disrupt the economy by providing goods at drastically lower prices, posing a threat to a system reliant on consumerism and advertising-driven jobs. The tension rises as Tracy grapples with the moral implications of defending an arguably flawed economic system while taking drastic measures to neutralize the perceived threat from Freer Enterprises.
