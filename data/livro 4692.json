    "resumo": "\"The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun\" by Nehemiah Grew is a scientific publication written in the late 17th century. The work delves into the anatomical structure and functions of plants, particularly focusing on the process of vegetation from seed to plant. Grew presents detailed observations and dissections of various vegetable parts, emphasizing the underlying principles of plant growth.  At the start of this treatise, Grew outlines his methodology and intentions, emphasizing the lack of prior comprehensive work on vegetable anatomy compared to animal anatomy. He introduces the garden bean as a primary subject for dissection, detailing its layers and internal structures. The opening chapters describe the anatomy of the seed, including its coats, main structures, and the roles of the radicle and plume in the growth of the plant. Grew encourages a systematic examination of vegetable anatomy to enhance understanding of the natural processes governing plant life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
