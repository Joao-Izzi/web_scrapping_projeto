    "resumo": "\"Sésame et les Lys: des trésors des rois, des jardins des reines\" by John Ruskin is a philosophical treatise written in the late 19th century. The work is a compilation of lectures that explore the significance of literature and its role in the development of moral and social vision. Ruskin emphasizes the transformative power of reading and advocates for the value of accessing great works of literature as a means of elevating human consciousness and character.  The opening of this treatise introduces the reader to Ruskin's reverent thoughts on the experience of reading, evoking nostalgia for childhood moments spent absorbed in beloved books. Through detailed and expressive reflections, he paints a picture of how literature intertwines with memory, shaping one's personal landscape and emotional life. As he articulates the profound connection between individuals and their literary encounters, he sets the stage for deeper examinations of the societal and ethical implications of reading in the forthcoming sections of the work. Marcel Proust’s translation adds another layer of richness, drawing connections between these historical literary discussions and personal experiences, making the discourse resonate with contemporary readers.
