    "resumo": "\"The Ivory Workers of the Middle Ages\" by Anna Maria Elizabeth Cust is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the artistry and craftsmanship of ivory workers from the early Christian era through the Middle Ages, detailing their works and the cultural significance of ivory carvings during this period. It aims to provide insights into the continuity and evolution of art despite the political and social upheavals following the fall of the Roman Empire.  At the start of the book, the author emphasizes the importance of ivory as a material throughout history, from prehistoric times to the medieval period. The opening chapters introduce the concept of diptychs—carved tablets used for various purposes, including religious ones—and discuss their role in the cultural fabric of that time. The narrative highlights significant examples of consular diptychs and various styles of ivory carvings that illustrate the transition from classical art to a more medieval form, reflecting on how these artworks encapsulate the historical shifts between the ancient and medieval worlds.
