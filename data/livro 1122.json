    "resumo": "\"Un cavallo nella luna: Novelle\" by Luigi Pirandello is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The book delves into various human experiences and emotions, often exploring themes of identity, madness, and the absurdities of life. Through a vivid cast of characters, including a troubled newlywed couple, Pirandello presents profound insights into their struggles and the interactions that define their lives.  At the start of the collection, the story introduces two newlyweds, Nino and Ida, who are supposed to enjoy their honeymoon on a desolate Italian hillside. However, Nino is visibly troubled, exhibiting signs of emotional distress possibly linked to a past love that led him to a suicidal break. While Ida tries to welcome her new life and cheer him up, the tension between their contrasting states evokes a sense of impending tragedy. Their initial joy starkly contrasts with Nino's inner turmoil, setting the stage for themes of love, despair, and the often chaotic nature of human relationships that permeates the entire collection.
