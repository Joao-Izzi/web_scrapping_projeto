    "resumo": "\"William Dampier\" by W. Clark Russell is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the life and adventures of the famous 17th-century explorer, pirate, and natural historian, William Dampier. It delves into Dampier's experiences on the seas, connecting his narrative to the broader context of navigation and piracy during that era.  The opening of the narrative introduces readers to the world of 17th-century buccaneers, characterizing them as a rugged and \"savage\" community engaged in hunting and piracy. It discusses the challenges faced by early mariners and the art of navigation at that time, illustrating the difficulties they encountered aboard unwieldy ships without modern instruments. This section sets the stage for focusing on Dampier himself, shedding light on how he differed from his contemporaries by possessing qualities of courage and seamanship, while also hinting at the romanticized yet brutal life of piracy and exploration that defined his voyages.
