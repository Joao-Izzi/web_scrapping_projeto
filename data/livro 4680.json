    "resumo": "\"A Foregone Conclusion\" by William Dean Howells is a novel written during the late 19th century. This literary work delves into themes of aspiration, misunderstanding, and the intersections between personal ambition and societal expectation through the character of Don Ippolito, a priest and inventor who seeks recognition and opportunity in Venice amid his numerous inventions.  At the start of the novel, we meet Don Ippolito as he navigates the streets of Venice, reflecting his anxious disposition while visiting the American consulate. He seeks assistance from Mr. Ferris, a consul who views him with suspicion, particularly after learning that Don Ippolito is an Austrian subject attempting to secure a passport to America. In his earnestness, he presents a unique weapon he believes could aid the Union Army, but faces rejection and skepticism. The opening chapters provide insight into both charactersâ€”how they represent broader themes of cultural misunderstanding and idealism versus practicality, particularly as Don Ippolito exudes hope interlaced with disappointment in his aspirations for invention and acceptance.
