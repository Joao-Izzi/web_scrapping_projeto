    "resumo": "\"Family Pride; Or, Purified by Suffering\" by Mary Jane Holmes is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story centers around the themes of family, social class, and personal growth, primarily exploring the life of Katy Lennox, a young woman returning home to her rural family after receiving a more polished education. As she reintegrates into her old surroundings, the contrast between her family's humble lifestyle and the expectations of high society, particularly with the arrival of her wealthy suitor Wilford Cameron, begins to unfold.  The opening of the novel introduces Uncle Ephraim Barlow, a deacon who embodies traditional values and lifestyles of old New England, as well as his bustling home filled with strong women like Aunt Hannah, Aunt Betsy, and the spirited Katy. As Katy arrives home after a year at boarding school, her excitement contrasts with her motherâ€™s insecurities regarding their social standing and the upcoming visit from her well-to-do suitor, Wilford. Tension arises as the family prepares to host him, revealing their struggle with how to present themselves in light of his wealth and societal expectations. Through various characters and their interactions, the narrative sets the stage for a deeper exploration of social pride, personal values, and the notion of being \"purified\" through life's hardships.
