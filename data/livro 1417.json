    "resumo": "\"Swenson, Dispatcher\" by R. De Witt Miller is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. The story is set in a future interplanetary society in the 22nd century, following the adventures of a determined dispatcher, Swenson, who navigates the complexities of space shipping regulations and corporate antics after securing a job with Acme Interplanetary Express. The novel combines elements of humor and drama, exploring themes of survival, ingenuity, and the absurdities of bureaucratic processes.  The narrative follows Patrick M. Swenson as he attempts to salvage the beleaguered Acme Interplanetary Express after the previous dispatcher has left the company in chaos. Charged with dealing with grounded ships, unpaid freight, and a potentially mutinous crew, Swenson employs a mix of wit and unconventional tactics to manage the crisis, including manipulating a Senator's speech for leverage. His unusual methods raise eyebrows but ultimately lead to a resolution that enables the company to regain its operational status. Throughout the story, Swenson's character shines through as both resourceful and irreverently humorous, depicted against the backdrop of a chaotic space transport industry.
