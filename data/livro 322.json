    "resumo": "\"A Girl in Ten Thousand\" by L. T. Meade is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Effie Staunton, a young girl who yearns to break free from her mundane home life to pursue a career as a nurse, inspired by her friendship with Dorothy Fraser, a modern and ambitious woman from London. The narrative explores themes of self-discovery and the struggle between familial duty and personal aspirations.  At the start of the novel, we witness a tense conversation between Effie and her mother, Mrs. Staunton, in which Effie expresses her desire to leave home and pursue a nursing profession, challenging traditional gender roles of the time. Effie's nurturing nature is highlighted as she tends to her younger siblings and assists her mother, who is increasingly frail. As Effie prepares to speak with her father about her ambitions, she is aware of the impending changes that her decisions might bring to her family's dynamic. The opening sets the stage for Effie's journey towards independence, against the backdrop of her mother's emotional struggles and the family's precarious financial situation.
