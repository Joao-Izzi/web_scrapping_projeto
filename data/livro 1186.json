    "resumo": "\"A Patriot Lad of Old Boston\" by Russell Gordon Carter is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around a young boy, Donald \"Don\" Alden, living in Boston during the turbulent period of British occupation leading up to the American Revolutionary War. The novel explores themes of loyalty, friendship, and youthful courage against the backdrop of significant events like the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Concord and Lexington.  The opening portion of the book introduces Don Alden and provides insight into the struggles faced by the townsfolk of Boston under British rule. It begins on the eve of the Boston Tea Party with a town meeting discussing the colonial protest against British taxation. Don's spirit of adventure and desire to stand up for what he believes in lead him to become involved in the chaotic events of that night when patriots disguised as Indians dump tea into the harbor. We also learn about his family dynamic, particularly his bond with his Aunt Martha, and his conflicted feelings about his best friend Tom, who is loyal to the King. As Don navigates these challenges, he embodies the spirit of the young patriots fighting for freedom. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
