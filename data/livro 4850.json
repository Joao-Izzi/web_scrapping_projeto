    "resumo": "\"Under Cover\" by Roi Cooper Megrue and Wyndham Martyn is a novel likely written in the early 20th century. The story opens in a vibrant, bustling Paris during the summer, where the main character, Monty Vaughan, an American, expresses his irritation at being mistaken for a tourist. The narrative takes a turn when he meets his old friend, Steven Denby, who seems to have a hidden past and brings an air of mystery and excitement to Monty's otherwise mundane life.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Monty Vaughan, who is feeling lonely and out of place in Paris where he has lived for two years. He unexpectedly encounters Steven Denby, an old school friend who hints at a life filled with danger and intrigue. The two engage in a conversation that reveals Denby's current involvement in smuggling pearls, which he proposes to take back to America with Montyâ€™s help. As Denby describes his situation and the potential risks involved, Monty becomes increasingly drawn to the idea of adventure, transforming his mundane existence into one filled with excitement and illicit undertakings. This sets the stage for a thrilling narrative that blurs the lines between right and wrong, drawing Monty further into a world of crime and danger. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
