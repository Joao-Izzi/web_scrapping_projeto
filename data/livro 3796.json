    "resumo": "\"Carlota of the Rancho\" by Evelyn Raymond is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around twin children, Carlos and Carlota Manuel, living on their father's ranch, Refugio, which straddles the borders of the United States and Mexico. The narrative likely explores themes of family, adventure, and the cultural nuances of border life through the eyes of the innocent twins as they navigate their reality, especially in relation to their absent father.  At the start of the tale, Carlos and Carlota engage in lighthearted banter while expressing their longing for their father, who is away. Their playful interactions reveal their deep bond and the weight of their father's absence on their emotions. Soon, their playful day turns serious as they encounter a group of unfamiliar travelers, which raises concerns about their safety. The opening segments set up a narrative rich in sibling dynamics, innocence, and the theme of protectionâ€”both from external threats and the emotional turmoil prompted by their father's absence. The twins' adventure unfolds in the vast landscape of their ranch, hinting at the challenges and discoveries that lie ahead. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
