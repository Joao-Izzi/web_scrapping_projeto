    "resumo": "\"Hiking Westward\" by Roger William Conant is a children's adventure novel written in the early 20th century. This story chronicles the experiences of two boys, Phil and Ted Porter, who embark on a journey to the American West in search of a homestead to provide for their family, particularly to support their ailing mother. The narrative captures their brave confrontations with the challenges of frontier life, emphasizing themes of responsibility and perseverance.  The opening portion of the book establishes a family dynamic where the Porter children discuss how they could support their mother, leading to Phil and Ted's ambitious plan to settle in the West. Shocked by the severity of their mother's health and the family's financial situation, they quickly dismiss their playful dreams of baseball and aviation and resolve to take up a homestead. Engaging in light-hearted banter with their sisters, they outline their intentions to their mother, displaying both determination and naivety regarding the realities of frontier living. Their transition from frivolous youth to responsible caretakers forms a central pillar of the story, setting the stage for the challenges they will encounter while pursuing their goal.
