    "resumo": "\"Short Snorter\" by Charles Einstein is a science fiction short story published in the late 1950s. The narrative centers around the unexpected encounter of a vacationing couple, Fred and Alice Daniels, with a peculiar flying saucer and its occupant, Mr. Steariot, who claims to be from Venus. The story explores themes of disbelief, the human tendency to judge by appearances—especially in relation to money—and the clash between the fantastical and the mundane in everyday settings.  The plot unfolds as Fred and Alice venture into the woods and discover a red flying saucer, which leads them to meet the seemingly ordinary Mr. Steariot, who is actually an extraterrestrial. Despite his polite demeanor and the legitimacy of his claims, the couple, along with the hotel manager Mr. Mason, grapple with their disbelief regarding his background. Steariot presents them with a Venusian banknote, a five-djino bill, as a souvenir, prompting reflections on the nature of value and belief. The story subtly critiques societal preoccupations with money and skepticism, illustrating how easily people dismiss extraordinary experiences when they don't fit comfortably within their understanding of the world.
