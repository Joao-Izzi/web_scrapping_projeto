    "resumo": "\"The Persian Mystics: Jámí\" by F. Hadland Davis is a collection of poetic works and teachings from the renowned Persian mystic poet Jámí, written in the early 20th century. This book provides insight into the mystical philosophy, love themes, and Sufi teachings that permeate Jámí's poetry, illustrating his quest for understanding the divine and the nature of love. It's a reflective exploration of the soul's journey and connection to the transcendent.  In this volume, the author delves into the life of Jámí alongside translations of his significant works, including the allegorical tales \"Salámán and Absál,\" and \"Yúsuf and Zulaikha,\" as well as the philosophical treatise \"Lawá'ih.\" The narratives often explore the tension between earthly love and divine love, presenting the characters’ struggles to attain spiritual enlightenment amid worldly distractions. Jámí’s poetry extends an invitation to the reader to ponder profound existential themes, such as the ephemeral nature of life, the interplay of reflection and truth, and the ultimate pursuit of a lover's union with the Divine. The selections reflect his belief that true knowledge and beauty can only be found through the soul's devotion to God, making this work a significant contribution to the understanding of Persian mysticism and literature.
