    "resumo": "\"A Colonial Reformer, Vol. 1 (of 3)\" by Rolf Boldrewood is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Mr. Ernest Neuchamp, a young man of noble aspirations who leaves his English roots for Australia, driven by ideals of social reform and improvement within a new colonial society. As he embarks on this journey, he embodies qualities similar to a crusader, seeking to cultivate a better life and guide the communities he encounters.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Ernest Neuchamp as he departs from his ancestral home, fueled by dreams of elevating the Australian populace through enlightened practices. The dialogue between him and his brother Courtenay reveals their contrasting views on colonial life and familial legacy. Once aboard the clipper ship to Australia, Ernest encounters fellow travelers, including the enigmatic Middleton family, whose differing perspectives intrigue him yet make him reconsider his assumptions about the colonists. By the time he arrives in Sydney, the realities of his aspirations clash with the familiar Englishness of the city, prompting reflections on the challenges he may face in achieving his noble ambitions amid the complexities of colonial life.
