    "resumo": "\"Little Rifle; or, The Young Fur Hunters\" by Edward Sylvester Ellis is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows a young boy named Little Rifle, who is an aspiring trapper and hunter living in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, particularly around the Upper Columbia River. As he navigates the challenges of this dangerous environment, he faces threats from both wildlife and the indigenous Blackfoot warriors, all while seeking to uncover the mysteries of his own past.  The opening portion presents Little Rifle as a resourceful and skilled young boy, adept at moving stealthily through the woods as he sets traps for beavers. His solitude is palpable as he reflects on his life and his unknown origins, having been raised by the trapper Old Ruff Robsart. This segment builds tension effectively, highlighting an impending confrontation with a Blackfoot Indian while introducing themes of survival, solitude, and the search for identity. As the narrative progresses, Little Rifle's bravery and wit become apparent, especially when he cleverly outsmarts an enemy hunter, setting the stage for further adventures in the wild.
