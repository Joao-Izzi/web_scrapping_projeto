    "resumo": "\"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz is a narrative poem written in the early 19th century. This epic poem centers on the lives of the nobility in Lithuania during the time post-Napoleonic Wars, unveiling their culture and social structures. The main character, Tadeusz Soplica, returns to his family's estate after finishing his education and finds himself entangled in various familial and societal conflicts, most notably concerning love and honor.  At the start of the poem, Tadeusz arrives at his family's estate, filled with nostalgia for his childhood and curious about the changes that have occurred in his absence. He explores the familiar surroundings and feels a sense of longing for his homeland. In this opening portion, we see the vibrancy of Lithuanian nature and the leisurely lifestyle of the gentry, along with hints of underlying tensions reflected in a dispute between noble families. Tadeusz’s first encounter with a mysterious young woman adds a romantic intrigue, setting the stage for the interpersonal drama and conflicts that will unfold throughout the narrative.
