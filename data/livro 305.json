    "resumo": "\"Prevailing Prayer: What Hinders It?\" by Dwight Lyman Moody is a religious treatise written in the late 19th century. The book focuses on the significance of prayer in the spiritual life of believers and explores the common obstacles that hinder effective prayer. Moody aims to equip Christians with a deeper understanding and practice of prayer through biblical examples and theological insights.  The opening of the book emphasizes the importance of prayer as a means of divine communication and spiritual growth. Moody draws on scriptural references, highlighting figures like Elijah, Daniel, and Christ Himself, to illustrate how prayer has historically played a pivotal role in changing circumstances and lives. The introductory chapters outline fundamental aspects of prayer, including adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and unity, suggesting that neglecting any of these elements can hinder one's relationship with God and the effectiveness of their prayers. Through these insights, Moody seeks to encourage readers to cultivate a consistent and earnest prayer life, assuring them that God is attentive and responsive to their sincere requests.
