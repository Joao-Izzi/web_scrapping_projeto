    "resumo": "\"Looking Seaward Again\" by Sir Walter Runciman is a collection of maritime tales written in the early 20th century. The narratives are drawn from the author's experiences on the seas and reflect the cultural and historical dimensions of seafaring life, likely touching on themes of adventure, conflict, and the nature of trade. As the tales seem to encompass various settings and characters, they promise a rich exploration of life on the ocean during a transformative period in maritime history.  At the start of the book, Runciman sets the stage with a preface that conveys a nostalgic tone about his time spent at sea and the storytelling sessions shared by the fireside. The opening portion introduces the first tale, \"Through Torpedoes and Ice,\" which recounts a thrilling maritime episode during a period of conflict, illustrating the perilous conditions faced by sailors navigating icy waters while avoiding enemy torpedoes. Characters experience both camaraderie and tension as they confront challenges crafted by nature and warfare. The story captures the essence of adventure at sea, carefully blending factual recounting with elements of drama, and thus invites readers into a world that celebrates the daunting, yet romantic, life of sailors.
