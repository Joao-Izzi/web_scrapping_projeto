    "resumo": "\"Love Insurance\" by Earl Derr Biggers is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around Lord Harrowby, an English nobleman who is concerned about marrying Cynthia Meyrick, a wealthy American heiress. With the wedding approaching, Harrowby seeks an unusual insurance policy to protect himself from the possibility of losing her affections, prompting a series of comedic and romantic entanglements as they navigate their feelings and societal expectations.  At the start of the novel, we meet Lord Harrowby, who arrives at a New York office to propose a bizarre insurance plan to the Lloyds firm—insuring against the chance of his fiancée changing her mind and abandoning him before their wedding. His interactions with the firm’s underwriters reveal his nervousness and the absurdity of his request, but they ultimately agree to help him. In the course of the opening chapters, Harrowby's plan takes off as we are introduced to Richard Minot, a capable assistant sent to ensure the wedding proceeds as planned. The beginning establishes a lighthearted tone infused with witty dialogue, intriguing characters, and the comedic elements of a romantic adventure. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
