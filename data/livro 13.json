    "resumo": "\"Earth's Enigmas: A Volume of Stories\" by Sir Charles G. D. Roberts is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. This anthology showcases various narratives that explore themes surrounding nature, human relationships, and the intricacies of life, revealing the emotional and physical landscapes that shape the characters' experiences. Each tale appears to be deeply cultivated with evocative imagery and a sense of wonder about the natural world.  The opening of the volume begins with a story titled \"Do Seek their Meat from God,\" which presents a vivid scene in a ravine where a pair of panthers, driven by hunger, stalk their prey. As the story unfolds, it captures a tense and atmospheric moment, where the panthers are drawn towards the cries of a lonely child left in a cabin by his inattentive father. The narrative highlights the instinctual nature of the animals alongside the innocence and vulnerability of the child, setting a dramatic stage for themes of survival and the primal connection to the wild. This gripping introduction immerses readers in the intertwining destinies of man and beast, emphasizing the intricate balance of life in the wilderness.
