    "resumo": "\"Cædwalla; or, The Saxons in the Isle of Wight: A Tale\" by Frank Cowper is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the character Cædwalla, a West Saxon king and outlaw, as he navigates the treacherous political landscape of 7th century Isle of Wight. This tale intertwines themes of bravery, revenge, and the struggle for power amidst the backdrop of early medieval England's shifting alliances and conflicts.  The opening of the tale introduces us to a dramatic scene set in the misty waters off the Isle of Wight, where three characters—a boys Ædric and Wulf, along with an older man called Biggun—struggle to free their stranded boat. Through their conversation, we learn of a recent attack that destroyed their home and left Ædric injured. As they attempt to find help, the story unfolds the harsh realities of their time, highlighting the dangers posed by raiders and the sense of survival that permeates their lives. The narrative quickly shifts to the introduction of Cædwalla and hints at the complex dynamics of power and loyalty that will play a significant role as the story progresses. The stage is set for adventure as the characters seek refuge and assistance amidst the dying remnants of a once-thriving community, underscoring the historical tension of the period.
