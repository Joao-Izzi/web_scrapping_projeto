    "resumo": "\"The Great Nebraska Sea\" by Allan Danzig is a science fiction novel written in the early 1960s. The book explores a cataclysmic geological event that transforms vast regions of North America into a new inland sea, fundamentally altering the geography and climate of the United States. The narrative combines elements of disaster fiction with speculative themes about environmental change and human adaptation.  The story unfolds as geologists observe unusual seismic activity along the Kiowa Fault, leading to unprecedented earthquakes and soil subsidence. As towns and infrastructure are decimated, millions of people are forced to flee eastward while a tidal wave sweeps away entire regions. Amid the chaos, a few fortunate individuals find refuge, including the Creeth family, who survive by seeking shelter in their barn. The aftermath of this disaster culminates in the formation of the Nebraska Sea, which brings significant climatic and economic changes to the region, resulting in new political landscapes and the emergence of cities and trade routes in areas previously considered barren. As the narrative reflects on the consequences of this transformation, it delves into themes of loss, survival, and the inexorable march of nature. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
