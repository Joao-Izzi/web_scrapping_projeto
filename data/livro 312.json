    "resumo": "\"Beer-Trust Busters\" by A. R. Stuart is a science fiction novel likely written in the mid-20th century. Set in a futuristic universe where space travel and asteroid mining are commonplace, the story revolves around a trio of unconventional heroes who devise a plan to take down an unscrupulous beer baron named Dudley D. Drake. The narrative blends humor with a classic struggle against corporate greed, specifically focusing on the manipulation and control of the beer supply in their society.  The plot follows Doc, Listless, and Outhouse as they attempt to disrupt Drake's monopolistic hold on the beer market. Their journey leads them to formulate an ingenious plan that involves creating a new sun by manipulating asteroids, thus presenting a threat to Drake's operations. Tension escalates when Drake discovers their scheme and attempts to thwart them, leading to a series of humorous and perilous confrontations. In the end, the protagonists not only achieve their goal of undermining Drake's business but also explore the potential for a new era in brewing and even entertain the idea of a personal retreat in space. The novel is characterized by lively dialogue, clever science fiction concepts, and a satirical view of corporate culture. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
