    "resumo": "\"Benighted\" by J. B. Priestley is a novel written in the late 1920s. The story begins with a tense and unsettling journey as the main characters, Philip, Margaret, and Penderel, navigate treacherous mountain roads during a storm. The narrative captures their struggles with both the harsh external environment and their internal conflicts, hinting at deeper themes of fear, isolation, and interpersonal dynamics.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Philip Waverton, who feels insecure while driving through the chaotic Welsh mountains amidst heavy rain and ominous weather. His wife, Margaret, expresses frustration about their predicament, suggesting they should have turned back. Penderel, their companion, injects humor and levity into the situation, but the looming threat of landslides and floods creates an atmosphere of anxiety. The trio's journey takes a dramatic turn when they find themselves trapped and eventually seek shelter in a mysterious and seemingly desolate house inhabited by the strange Femm family. The opening sets a tone of suspense and introduces readers to a blend of the ordinary and the uncanny, foreshadowing the challenges the characters will face as they confront both natureâ€™s fury and their own complex relationships.
