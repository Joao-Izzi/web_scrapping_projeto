The opening of the novel introduces the desolate beauty of Dartmoor and establishes its atmosphere as a central character. Maurice Malherb is depicted as he contemplates the potential of the land while confronting the harsh realities of farming in such a challenging environment. Through his encounter with Lovey Lee, an old servant and a figure shrouded in mystery and suspicion, the narrative begins to unravel notions of trust, legacy, and the complexities of rural life.
