    "resumo": "\"Problem in Solid\" by George O. Smith is a science fiction story published in the late 1940s. The narrative revolves around advanced concepts of photography and duplication, exploring the implications of creating three-dimensional images and the complex moral consequences that ensue from such technology.  The plot centers on Martin Hammer, a film producer, and Tim Woodart, an engineer who has invented a revolutionary way to create lifelike, three-dimensional images. The story takes a darker turn with the character Harry Foster, a motion picture star whose duplicity leads him to create a duplicate of himself, which ultimately results in murder. As the investigation unfolds, themes of identity, morality, and the nature of existence are examined, culminating in a courtroom drama where the distinctions between original and duplicate become entangled in a legal and ethical quagmire. The story highlights the consequences of technological advancement and raises questions about life, reality, and the law in a unique narrative style. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
