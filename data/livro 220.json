    "resumo": "\"Nonsenseorship\" by George Palmer Putnam et al. is a collection of essays exploring the themes of censorship and societal prohibitions, likely conceived during the early 20th century. The text provides a critical, often humorous look at the absurdities surrounding censorship, particularly in relation to Prohibition and the cultural landscape of America at the time, involving various contributors who share their unique perspectives on the subject matter.  The opening of the work introduces the concept of \"nonsenseorship\" and sets the tone for an engaging critique of societal and literary censorship. It features a variety of contributors, including satirical examinations of censorshipâ€™s impact on literature, culture, and individual freedoms. For instance, Heywood Broun humorously illustrates the irrationality of censorship by comparing it to the historical lack of control over human behavior, while other contributors discuss the consequences of Prohibition on societal norms and personal freedoms. This diverse range of voices makes the text a lively and thought-provoking read on the whims and follies of censorship. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
