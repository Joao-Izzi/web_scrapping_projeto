    "resumo": "\"The Bible, Douay-Rheims, Book 38: Micheas\" is a prophetic book from the Old Testament attributed to the prophet Micah, written during the 8th century BCE. As part of the biblical canon, it functions as a religious text that conveys messages from God regarding justice, morality, and the future of Israel and its people. The book covers themes of divine judgment, the consequences of sin, and the hope for redemption, presenting a blend of warnings and promises.  In the text, Micah prophesies the destruction of Samaria and Jerusalem due to the pervasive wickedness and idolatry of the people. He vividly describes the impending invasion by the Assyrians as a divine punishment. The prophet condemns the injustices committed by the wealthy elites against the poor and criticizes corrupt leaders and false prophets who lead the people astray. Despite the grim outlook, Micah also conveys a message of hope, foretelling a future restoration of Israel and the coming of a ruler from Bethlehem, whose birth signifies peace and the transformative power of God's love. Ultimately, the book balances admonitions of judgment with the assurance of God's mercy and redemption. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
