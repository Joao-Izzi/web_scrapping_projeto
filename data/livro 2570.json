    "resumo": "\"The King's Sons\" by George Manville Fenn is a historical novel written during the late 19th century. The book focuses on the life of King Ethelwulf of Wessex and his four sons, with a particular emphasis on the youngest, Alfred, who later earned the title of Alfred the Great. Through this narrative, the book explores themes of education, leadership, and the contrasting paths of the royal siblings as they prepare to take on the responsibilities of kingship during a turbulent period marked by Viking invasions.  The story begins with the four royal sons enjoying their youth in the beautiful hills of Berkshire, while their tutor, Father Swythe, attempts to instill in them the importance of education, particularly the art of reading and writing. While the elder brothers are more focused on martial skills, Alfred shows a keen interest in the lessons, leading to moments of conflict and eventual growth. As the narrative progresses, it highlights the boys' adventures, their relationship with Father Swythe, and the impending threat of the Viking invasions. This culminates in King Ethelwulf's eventual battle against the invaders and the legacy left behind by Alfred, whose dedication to learning and leadership ultimately contributes to his reputation as a great king. The novel provides both historical insight and a coming-of-age story that reflects the virtues of wisdom and bravery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
