    "resumo": "\"The Furious Rose\" by Dean Evans is a science fiction short story that appeared in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" in the early 1950s. Set in a dystopian future where executions are mechanized and devoid of human emotion, the narrative explores themes of morality, justice, and the emotional toll of bureaucratic duty. The central topic revolves around the mechanized execution process where society has lost its humanity in the name of progress.  The story follows Tony Radek, the Federal Executioner, as he navigates his role in an emotionally detached system where the condemned are subjected to \"Neg-Emote,\" a process that strips them of their emotions following a guilty verdict. When Tony encounters John's wife, Mrs. Haley, waiting in despair over her husband's impending execution, he grapples with a moral dilemma: to ease her pain by shielding her from the reality of her husband's fate or to uphold the cold efficiency expected of him. As the execution approaches, Tony's internal conflict intensifies, revealing the crushing weight of his responsibilities and the cruel absurdities of a society where life and death decisions are mere clockwork. Ultimately, the story presents a bleak commentary on the nature of justice and the cost of emotional detachment in a world ruled by bureaucratic rigidity.
