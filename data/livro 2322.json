    "resumo": "\"Time Fuze\" by Randall Garrett is a science fiction novella written in the mid-20th century. The story revolves around the consequences of experimenting with a new form of faster-than-light travel known as the ultradrive. As the crew of the first interstellar vessel, they encounter a catastrophic event—a nearby star going nova—prompting a series of unsettling revelations about the potential dangers of their innovative technology.  The narrative follows Commander Benedict and Dr. Leicher as they navigate the implications of their ship's ultradrive, which seems to have unwittingly caused a star to explode. They grapple with the staggering odds against such an event occurring simultaneously with their journey, leading to a disturbing realization: their technology may trigger similar catastrophic outcomes for their home star, Sol. In an atmosphere charged with tension and uncertainty, they must decide how to return home without endangering their own sun, culminating in an unresolved cliffhanger that leaves readers contemplating the potential repercussions of humanity's quest for advancement in space exploration.
