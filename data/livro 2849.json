    "resumo": "\"The Origin of Paul's Religion\" by J. Gresham Machen is a theological analytical work written in the early 20th century. This book explores the historical and theological foundations of Christianity by examining the apostle Paul's role in its inception. It delves into the complexities surrounding Paul’s teachings and how they contributed to the broader Christian belief system, particularly his understanding of Jesus Christ.  The opening of the text introduces the subject matter and outlines the significance of understanding the origin of Christianity, particularly through the lens of Paul’s contributions. Machen argues that Christianity’s establishment and its teachings cannot be divorced from their historical context, particularly the life and influence of Paul. He sets the stage for a detailed examination of Paul's religious experiences, including his Jewish upbringing and the transformative encounter that directed him towards his mission to the Gentiles. By doing so, Machen establishes the groundwork for an in-depth discussion on how Paul’s journey and doctrines significantly shaped early Christian thought.
