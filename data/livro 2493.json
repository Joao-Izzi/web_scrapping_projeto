    "resumo": "\"An Irish Cousin; vol. 1/2\" by Geilles Herring and Martin Ross is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows Theodora \"Theo\" Sarsfield, a young woman of American descent, who embarks on a journey to Ireland to reconnect with her father's family after a difficult upbringing. As she arrives in her ancestral home of Durrus, she navigates the complex dynamics of her relatives, their cultural quirks, and her own expectations of what life in Ireland will hold.  At the start of the narrative, Theo is on the s.s. Alaska, heading towards Queenstown, brimming with excitement and a hint of trepidation about her new life. Once introduced to her cousin Willy and her Uncle Dominick, she quickly realizes that her romanticized notions of Irish family life may not align with the reality she encounters. Despite the warmth of her cousin Willy, whose personality contrasts starkly with the cold demeanor of her uncle, Theo finds herself feeling more isolated than ever in this foreign home. The opening chapters set the stage for exploring her relationships, the surrounding landscape, and her gradual understanding of her fatherâ€™s legacy, immersing readers in both the personal and cultural nuances of her journey.
