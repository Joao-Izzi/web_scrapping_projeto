    "resumo": "\"The Book-Bills of Narcissus\" by Richard Le Gallienne is a novel written during the late 19th century. The book intricately explores the life and character of Narcissus, whom the narrator reflects upon in an autobiographical style, capturing themes of youth, literature, and memory through the lens of their friendship and shared experiences.  The opening of the novel introduces the narrator's contemplations, sparked by a comment from a bootmaker about how old men's boots can't go certain places. This leads to the establishment of a philosophical framework regarding personal accounts and memories, particularly through the metaphor of book-bills that the main character, Narcissus, accumulates over time. The narrative begins with the discovery of these book-bills, signifying the rich inner life of Narcissus and how they encapsulate his youth and passions. The narrator reminisces about old friends, including a visit to a quaint bookshop, where the character of Narcissus, with the allure of his intellectual pursuits and charming personality, begins to emerge as a central figure in a tale that promises to weave through the past and its influence on the present.
