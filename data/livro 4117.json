    "resumo": "\"A Voyage to Abyssinia\" by Jerónimo Lobo is a historical account written in the late 17th century, detailing the experiences of a Jesuit missionary's travels to Abyssinia, now known as Ethiopia. The narrative centers on Father Lobo's mission to convert Abyssinians to Catholicism, under the protection of Emperor Segued, and describes the perils he faced along the way, including encounters with hostile forces and the cultural practices he observed during his travels.  At the start of the book, Father Lobo recounts his early experiences after embarking on a mission from Goa, facing numerous trials and tribulations, including shipwrecks and conflicts with English and Dutch ships. After arriving in Abyssinia, he shares the challenges posed by treacherous landscapes and hostile natives, along with personal anecdotes that illustrate the customs and character of the Abyssinian people. The opening chapters set the stage for an adventurous and informative journey filled with reflections on spirituality, culture, and the nature of humanity.
