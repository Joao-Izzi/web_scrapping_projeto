    "resumo": "\"Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire, (Vol. 16 / 20)\" by Adolphe Thiers is a historical account written in the mid-19th century. This volume, part of a comprehensive series, delves into the political and military events during the French Consulate and the subsequent Empire, focusing extensively on Napoleon's strategic decisions and military maneuvers. Thiers' work aims to provide a detailed narrative of Napoleon's rule and the tumultuous era of his emergence as a dominant figure in European history.  The opening of this volume sets the stage for diplomatic and military confrontations involving Napoleon as he navigates tensions with Austria. It narrates critical developments surrounding the armistice with Austria, detailing Napoleon's preparations and strategic plans while hinting at his reluctance to accept terms that could compromise his authority and ambitions. Notably, the text establishes the context for the forthcoming negotiations and battles, encapsulating the atmosphere of urgency and military preparedness that would characterize the events of 1813. Through vivid descriptions of military camps, negotiations, and key players like M. de Bubna and M. de Metternich, Thiers effectively captures the complexity and stakes of the political landscape during this pivotal moment in history.
