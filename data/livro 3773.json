    "resumo": "\"The Master of the Ceremonies\" by George Manville Fenn is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds in the quaint seaside town of Saltinville, focusing on the Denville family, particularly Claire Denville and her father, Stuart Denville, the titular Master of the Ceremonies. Readers are introduced to themes of societal expectations, the struggles of genteel poverty, and family dynamics, laying the groundwork for a tale that hints at both romance and darker anxieties.  The opening of the book sets a serene scene in Saltinville as early morning light casts a beautiful glow over the bustling activity of the local fish market. Claire Denville is depicted as a gentle and capable young woman, devoted to supporting her family amid financial hardship. The content hints at an underlying tension within their household, particularly regarding her father's precarious financial situation, which is compounded by secrets and shame that plague the family. As the narrative unfolds, a sense of foreboding emerges, particularly when Claire's interactions with her father and the distant cries from Lady Teigne's chambers suggest darker events ahead, intertwining the charm of the coastal setting with a web of mystery and emotional turmoil.
