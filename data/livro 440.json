    "resumo": "\"The Butterfly's Funeral\" by J. L. B. is a poetic work published in the early 19th century. This book serves as a sequel to the earlier poem \"The Butterfly's Ball and Grasshopper's Feast\" and captures the theme of loss and mourning within an enchanting insect world. The work reflects on the fragility of life and the cycle of nature, using vibrant imagery to convey its message.  In \"The Butterfly's Funeral,\" the whimsical character of the Butterfly has passed away, prompting a somber gathering of fellow insects who come together to pay their respects. The narrative unfolds with the expressions of grief from various creatures, such as the Grasshopper, Bee, and Moth, as they embark on the Butterfly's funeral. Symbolic elements are woven throughout, such as the preparation of the grave by the Mole and the comforting presence of flowers that will bloom over time. The poem concludes with an epitaph that emphasizes beauty and remembrance, resonating with themes of friendship and the transient nature of existence. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
