    "resumo": "\"Carter, and Other People\" by Don Marquis is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The opening story, \"Carter,\" follows the experiences of a man named Carter, who grapples with his mixed heritage as a mulatto in the American South and later in New York, exploring themes of identity, race, and social acceptance. Through Carter's eyes, the story reveals the internal struggles and societal challenges faced by individuals caught between two worlds.  The opening of the book introduces Carter as he reflects on his life from childhood to adulthood. Born in Atlanta, he is acutely aware of his racial identity, feeling the pain of being neither fully accepted in the white community nor in the black community. The narrative captures his fleeting moments of self-acceptance intertwined with intense feelings of bitterness and envy, especially toward his half-brother, Willoughby Howard, who enjoys the privileges of their shared white ancestry. As Carter moves to New York seeking a better life, he finds his internal conflict deepening, especially when he falls in love with a woman who seems indifferent to his racial identity, ultimately leading to a heartbreaking self-rejection when he cannot reconcile with who he is in a society rigidly divided by race.
