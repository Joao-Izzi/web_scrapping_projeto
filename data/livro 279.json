    "resumo": "\"Shakespeare and the Stage\" by Maurice Jonas is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book explores the development and nuances of English drama, focusing particularly on the theatrical landscape during Shakespeare's time. It details the origins of the English stage, the evolution of performance venues, and the societal attitudes toward theatre, illuminating the rich context within which Shakespeare's works were produced and enjoyed.  The opening of the text delves into the early history of English drama, tracing its roots back to religious Miracle Plays performed during significant church festivals in medieval times. Jonas explains how these performances evolved from the church into secularized open-air productions, highlighting the transition from clergy-only actors to a more diverse group of performers, including guild members and professional entertainers. He sets the stage for understanding how this shift led to the establishment of more formal theatres and the vibrant theatrical culture that thrived during the Elizabethan era, culminating in the flourishing of Shakespeare's unparalleled body of work.
