    "resumo": "\"Taboo and Genetics\" by Melvin M. Knight, Ph.D., Iva Lowther Peters, Ph.D., and Phyllis Blanchard, Ph.D., is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work investigates the biological, sociological, and psychological foundations of the family, focusing on how scientific advancements in biology have led to a re-evaluation of traditional sociological views regarding sex and family dynamics.  The opening of the text serves as a preface, outlining the authors' intention to revisit and challenge established theories about sex and social structures, particularly in light of recent biological findings. They indicate a need to dissect the outdated \"gyn√¶cocentric\" theory that dominated sociological thought, acknowledging its inaccuracies while proposing a multidisciplinary approach to understanding sexual relationships. This includes examining the historical influence of sex taboos as well as integrating insights from modern psychology and ethnology to provide a comprehensive overview of how these factors converge to impact family life and societal norms today.
