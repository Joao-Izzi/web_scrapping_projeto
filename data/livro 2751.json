    "resumo": "\"The Influence of Old Norse Literature on English Literature\" by Conrad Hjalmar Nordby is a scholarly publication written in the early 20th century that explores the impact of Old Norse literature on the development of English literary forms and themes. The book likely examines how the rich narratives and poetic traditions of Old Norse works have permeated and influenced notable English writers, from Thomas Gray to William Morris and beyond, showcasing a blend of Nordic myth and Germanic tradition in English literature.  The opening of the work serves as a preface and introduction, outlining the author's background and the motivation behind his studies. Nordby stresses the kinship between the Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon languages, suggesting that readers already engage with Norse tales through the framework of their literary heroes. He begins with a historical overview of Old Norse literature, detailing its origins and evolution up to the medieval period, and highlights the notable transformations in English poetry that reflect Norse influences, notably in the works of poets like Thomas Gray, whose adaptations of Norse themes mark a significant shift toward Romanticism in literature. As Nordby sets the stage for his analytical journey, he emphasizes the emotional resonance that these ancient stories hold in contemporary literature, fostering a renewed appreciation for their enduring legacy.
