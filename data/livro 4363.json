    "resumo": "\"The Passing of the Idle Rich\" by Frederick Townsend Martin is a social critique written in the early 20th century. The work delves into the dynamics of American society, particularly focusing on the excesses and moral failings of the wealthy class, which the author dubs the \"idle rich.\" Martin aims to explore the impact of rapid industrialization and its consequences on social structures and values, suggesting that the idle rich contribute to the degradation of society's foundations.  At the start of the book, the author establishes his personal background to give credibility to his observations about society. He reflects on the evolution of American society, characterizing it as an oligarchy led by the idle rich, whose behaviors and values have infiltrated and corrupted the social fabric. Martin laments the departure from simpler, more virtuous ideals and traditions, criticizing the meaningless extravagance and moral decay that characterize the contemporary elite. He suggests that this idleness and self-indulgence have not only tarnished the spirit of American society but have also set the stage for class conflicts and societal unrest.
