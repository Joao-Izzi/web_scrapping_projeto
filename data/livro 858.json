    "resumo": "\"Journal de Eugène Delacroix, Tome 1 (de 3)\" by Eugène Delacroix is a collection of personal journals written in the early to mid-19th century. The author's notes span a significant portion of his life, capturing his thoughts, artistic reflections, and intimate experiences as one of France's foremost painters. The journal serves as both a reflection of Delacroix's inner life and a document that chronicles the artistic and public events he engaged with throughout his career.  The opening of this journal introduces readers to the nature and purpose of Delacroix's writing. It offers a glimpse into the artist's daily life, showcasing his spontaneous thoughts and reflections on art, politics, and the people around him. Commencing when he was just 22 years old, the journal captures his fervent youth and gradually reveals a more refined insight as he matures. Unorganized yet rich with personal detail, these entries not only reflect the artist's creative process but also document the influences and historical context of his time, providing a vivid portrait of an artist intertwined with the intellectual currents of the 19th century.
