Set against the backdrop of a looming financial panic, the story revolves around the lives of two opposing trust company presidents, John G. Slade and Bernard L. Majendie, each embroiled in a high-stakes drama of ambition, power, and intrigue. The initial chapters introduce a tense atmosphere where the characters navigate through personal struggles and financial peril, hinting at deeper dynamics between them and linking their fates in unexpected ways.  At the start of the novel, the scene is set in a New York apartment where Mrs. Rita Kildair hosts a gathering that transforms into a mysterious drama when her valuable ruby ring goes missing. A tense atmosphere unfolds as the guests are drawn into the intrigue surrounding the theft, leading to a gripping ultimatum: the lights are extinguished, and the culprit is urged to return the ring within a count of one hundred seconds. The tensions rise dramatically when the ring is not returned by the end of the count, resulting in an unsettling revelation that there may be more than one thief among them.
