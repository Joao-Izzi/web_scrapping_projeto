    "resumo": "\"Four Girls and a Compact\" by Annie Hamilton Donnell is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves around four young women—Loraine, Laura Ann, T.O. (Thomasia O. Brown), and Billy—who are navigating life as workers in a bustling city. Tired and yearning for a break, they concoct a plan to escape the heat and chaos of urban life for a summer in the countryside, leading them to an adventure filled with personal growth, friendship, and the search for a place to relax and rejuvenate.  At the start of the novel, the four girls gather in their small flat, excitedly discussing their \"Grand Plan\" to spend the summer away from the city. They ultimately vote to leave, hoping to find a restful retreat where they can enjoy nature and leisure. As they contemplate logistics, characteristics of each girl quickly emerge through their dialogue and interactions. T.O., the seemingly unremarkable \"Talentless One,\" volunteers to find their ideal summer home, embarking on an adventure that takes her to Placid Pond. This opening portion sets the tone for a heartwarming exploration of their lives, dreams, and the bonds they share as they embark on their journey together.
