    "resumo": "\"The Vision and Creed of Piers Ploughman, Volume 2\" by William Langland is an allegorical poem written in the 14th century. This work is part of a larger narrative that explores themes of morality, spirituality, and social justice through the protagonist Piers, who represents Christ-like virtues and the common man. The poem weaves together philosophical discussions and social criticism, inviting readers to contemplate the nature of faith, the struggles of the poor, and the ethics of the wealthy.  At the start of the volume, the protagonist Haukyn speaks with Conscience and Pacience, discussing themes of guilt, sin, and the merits of a humble life. They explore the balance between worldly existence and spiritual purity, emphasizing the importance of contrition and charitable actions over material wealth. Haukyn expresses regret for his sinful past and seeks guidance on how to live a more righteous life, culminating in a deeper understanding of moral integrity and the value of helping those in need. This opening sets the stage for the exploration of Piers's journey toward embodying these ideals and the lessons that stem from recognizing one's moral responsibilities.
