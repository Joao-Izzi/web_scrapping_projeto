    "resumo": "\"Pagan and Christian Rome\" by Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This work explores the cultural and religious transformation of Rome from paganism to Christianity, discussing significant changes in architecture, customs, and societal attitudes towards faith. The book delves into the intricate interplay between the remnants of pagan traditions and the burgeoning Christian beliefs that shaped the ancient city.  The opening of the book presents a discussion on the early adoption of Christianity among various social classes in Rome, challenging the notion that it was solely a religion for the poor. Lanciani cites examples of Roman nobles and even public officials who embraced the new faith, highlighting how early Christians navigated their beliefs in a predominantly pagan society. The chapter describes the gradual transformation of the city, the influences of notable Christian families, and the repurposing of pagan sites for Christian uses. By intertwining archaeological discoveries with ancient historical accounts, the author sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how Rome evolved during this pivotal period.
