    "resumo": "\"Glasses\" by Henry James is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows a young artist who navigates the complex social dynamics of a seaside resort, particularly focusing on his interactions with a beautiful young woman named Flora Saunt, who is portrayed as captivating yet profoundly self-absorbed. The narrative lays the groundwork for exploring themes of vanity, societal expectations, and the impact of beauty on personal relationships.  The opening of the book introduces the narrator, who reflects on the various characters at Folkestone, particularly drawing attention to Flora and her close association with Mrs. Meldrum, a widow with a bold personality. As the narrator observes Flora's interactions, he becomes intrigued by her charm and the delicate nuances that come with her beauty. Conversations between the characters reveal Flora's precarious position in society, suggesting that despite her allure, she is vulnerable and perhaps even naive about the consequences of her vanity. This complexity sets the stage for further developments in the story as the narrator's artistic fascination with Flora intertwines with the emerging complications surrounding her life and impending choices.
