    "resumo": "\"International Short Stories: French\" by Francis J. Reynolds et al. is a collection of short stories compiled in the early 20th century. The anthology features works by various acclaimed authors, each offering a unique insight into French culture and society through their storytelling. The tales range from poignant reflections on love, loss, and social commentary, showcasing characters from all walks of life, including soldiers, aristocrats, and outcasts.  The opening of the collection presents \"A Piece of Bread\" by Francois Coppee, where we meet the young Duc de Hardimont, who grapples with the harsh realities of war while reminiscing about his privileged past. After enlisting in the army, he encounters Jean-Victor, a starving soldier recovering from injuries. The two share a moment of camaraderie over a piece of bread, which the duke, feeling ashamed for having initially wasted, offers to share. The narrative delves into themes of class disparity, empathy, and the stark contrasts between the lives of the affluent and the impoverished, setting a poignant tone that reflects the larger societal issues present in the other stories of the collection.
