    "resumo": "\"Travels in Central Asia\" by Ármin Vámbéry is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book narrates Vámbéry's journey through Central Asia, particularly focusing on regions such as Teheran, Khiva, Bokhara, and Samarcand. His exploration aims to study and understand the relationship between the Hungarian language and Turkic and Tartar dialects, as well as to provide insights into the cultures and peoples of the area.  At the start of his travels, Vámbéry describes his experiences in Persia, detailing his arrival in Teheran and his observations of the local culture and politics. He reflects on his transformation into the disguised character of a Dervish to better integrate with the locals while gathering information for his studies. Through vivid portrayals of the landscape and interactions with fellow travelers and local inhabitants, Vámbéry sets an engaging tone for his adventures ahead, laying the groundwork for the rich narratives and encounters that will define his journey across the Turkoman desert to the heart of Central Asia.
