    "resumo": "\"Chaucer's Works, Volume 2 — Boethius and Troilus\" by Geoffrey Chaucer is a literary collection written in the 14th century. This volume includes Chaucer's translation of \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" by Boethius, which explores themes of misfortune and the nature of happiness, and the narrative poem \"Troilus and Criseyde,\" which revolves around the tragic love story between the Trojan prince Troilus and the beautiful Criseyde. The works reflect Chaucer's engagement with philosophical questions and romantic ideals, offering readers a glimpse into medieval thought and literature.  The opening of this volume sets the stage for an exploration of the profound themes presented in the two central works. It begins with an introduction to Boethius, detailing his philosophical disputes and unfortunate imprisonment, which sparks the creation of his \"Consolation of Philosophy.\" In this section, Chaucer emphasizes Boethius's plight and the comforting presence of Philosophy as a guiding figure. The excerpt also touches upon Chaucer’s connections to Boethius's ideas, suggesting a blend of philosophical inquiry and poetic narrative that will define the ensuing texts. Overall, this introduction hints at the depth of existential reflection and emotional storytelling that characterize the upcoming works. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
