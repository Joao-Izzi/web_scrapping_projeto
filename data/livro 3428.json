    "resumo": "\"The Counterpane Fairy\" by Katharine Pyle is a children's fantasy story likely written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around a young boy named Teddy who is confined to bed due to illness. During this time, he encounters the whimsical Counterpane Fairy, who offers to transport him into magical stories that unfold from the squares of his counterpane quilt. The book explores themes of imagination, bravery, and coping with loneliness through Teddy's enchanting adventures.  At the start of this enchanting tale, Teddy is feeling lonely and under the supervision of his mother while he recovers from an illness. As he gazes out the window, a fairy appears, introducing herself as the Counterpane Fairy. She explains that she is here to show Teddy a magical story, prompting him to choose a square on his quilt. Teddy selects a yellow square, and with the fairy's guidance, he finds himself in a golden garden where he learns he is a hero destined to rescue an enchanted princess. The narrative engages the reader with vivid imagery and a sense of wonder, as Teddy embarks on his quest, overcoming obstacles and facing challenges with the guidance of the fairy. This opening portion sets the stage for a series of adventures that explore Teddy's courage and the magic of storytelling. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
