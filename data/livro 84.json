    "resumo": "\"Claire d'Albe\" by Madame Cottin is a novel written in the late 18th century. The story centers around the life and emotions of Claire d'Albe, a woman grappling with the complexities of love and virtue within the confines of her societal role. The early chapters suggest a focus on Claire's relationships, particularly with her husband and a young man named Frédéric, which hint at themes of forbidden passion and moral dilemmas.  The opening of the novel introduces Claire's perspective as she writes letters to her friend Elise, reflecting on her emotional struggles and the joys and challenges of her domestic life. Claire feels torn between her responsibilities as a wife and mother and her feelings of longing and desire for deeper connections, especially with Frédéric, who is described as charming and earnest. The letters reveal Claire's character as compassionate and self-aware, while also setting up a tension that suggests her interactions with Frédéric may develop into something more complicated and troubling. Themes of friendship, virtue, and the tumultuous nature of emotions begin to emerge, providing a foundation for the conflicts that may unfold in the story.
