    "resumo": "\"Cicero's Brutus, or History of Famous Orators; also His Orator, or Accomplished Speaker\" by Marcus Tullius Cicero is a collection of rhetorical works written in the 1st century BC. The text serves as both a dialogue and a treatise on eloquence, focusing on the lives and styles of prominent orators from ancient Greece and Rome, exploring their contributions to the art of persuasion.  The opening of this work introduces Cicero's reflections on the recently deceased orator Hortensius, expressing deep personal sorrow but also a broader concern for the impact on Roman society due to the loss of such eloquent figures. As he converses with friends Brutus and Atticus, Cicero reflects on the importance of eloquence in the legal and political arenas, indicating a desire to discuss the history of famous orators, their methods, and the evolution of oratory itself. This sets up an exploration of notable figures in eloquence, linking their rhetorical skills to the political realities of Ciceroâ€™s time and the dynamics of Roman governance.
