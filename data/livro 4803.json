    "resumo": "\"War and the Weird\" by Forbes Phillips and R. Thurston Hopkins is a collection of essays written in the early 20th century. The book explores the intersection of war experiences and the supernatural, delving into themes of premonition, spiritual awareness, and mystical encounters faced by soldiers during wartime. The text appears to offer a blend of personal narratives and philosophical musings, reflecting on the uncanny experiences that arise amidst the horrors of battle.  The opening of the book introduces us to a wounded British officer reflecting on the strange and uncanny occurrences surrounding soldiers during the Great War. He recounts a discussion with fellow soldiers, sharing their experiences of dreams, premonitions, and supernatural beliefs that surface in the chaos of combat. They ponder the nature of these supernatural experiences, suggesting that such moments may arise from the heightened emotional states and psychological stress of warfare. The officer's musings set a tone that merges personal anecdotes with broader philosophical questions about the spiritual dimensions of human existence, framing the battlefield as a site where extraordinary phenomena occur, leading to deeper explorations of life, death, and belief in the unseen realms.
