    "resumo": "\"Archeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895\" by Jesse Walter Fewkes is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work documents an archaeological field expedition to Arizona, focusing on ancient Pueblo ruins, particularly cliff houses, as well as mortuary pottery and other artifacts. Fewkes aims to uncover historical insights related to the prehistoric inhabitants of the region and how their cultures developed over time.  At the start of the memoir, Fewkes introduces his expedition, explaining the invitation he received to collect archaeological specimens for the National Museum, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of ruins in Verde Valley and Tusayan. He details his initial preparations, collaborators, and the nature of his findings, emphasizing the challenge of documenting and understanding ancient Pueblo life. The opening portion lays the groundwork for a systematic survey of the region’s archaeological features, illustrating the author’s enthusiasm and the scientific rigor he brings to his observations, as he hopes to link the past inhabitants of Arizona with the traditions of present-day Hopi Indians.
