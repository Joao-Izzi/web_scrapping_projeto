    "resumo": "\"Pormestarin vaimo: Romaani\" by Georg Ebers is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set in 1574, during the Eighty Years' War between the Dutch and the Spanish, the story explores themes of patriotism, youth, and the struggles for freedom. The main character, Adrian van der Werff, is the son of the town's mayor in Leiden and is depicted navigating the tensions between his heritage, his desires, and the political turmoil of the time.  The opening of the novel sets a vivid scene in Leiden, where the spring of 1574 brings both natural beauty and a sense of renewal following a military siege. As the citizens celebrate their freedom, the narrative introduces the passionate youth in a classroom, where Adrian and his friends are inspired by a speech that challenges them to think of their duty to their country. This moment foreshadows the boys' subsequent inevitable foray into playacting battles, symbolizing their inner conflict between childhood innocence and the harsh realities of war. The chapter unfolds Adrian's relationships with his family, including a sense of longing for approval from his formidable father, as well as his budding interest in matters of national pride and identity amidst the backdrop of societal upheaval.
