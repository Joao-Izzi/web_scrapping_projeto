    "resumo": "\"The Declaration of Independence of The United States of America\" by Thomas Jefferson is a historical document written in the late 18th century. This seminal text serves as a foundational piece of American history, articulating the colonies' intent to separate from British rule. The book details the philosophical and political reasons behind the decision to pursue independence.  In the Declaration, Jefferson outlines the inherent rights of individuals, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, asserting that governments exist to protect these rights and are legitimate only through the consent of the governed. The text boldly enumerates grievances against King George III, showcasing the perceived tyranny and abuse of power that justified the colonies' break from Britain. Ultimately, the Declaration proclaims that the thirteen colonies are free and independent states, paving the way for the establishment of a new nation grounded in democratic principles.
