    "resumo": "\"Politics of Alabama\" by Joseph C. Manning is a historical account written during the late 19th century. The book examines the political dynamics and corruption within Alabama during a time of significant electoral conflict, specifically focusing on the controversial gubernatorial election between Captain R. F. Kolb and Thomas G. Jones in 1892. Manning passionately critiques the practices of the Democratic Party and highlights the electoral fraud and manipulations that significantly influenced the election outcomes.  In this book, Manning details the contentious Kolb-Jones contest, revealing widespread electoral fraud characterized by ballot stuffing, the alteration of vote counts, and intimidation tactics employed by party leaders. The narrative is interwoven with accounts of the socio-political climate in Alabama, where the so-called \"machine bosses\" maintained a chokehold on the electoral process, thereby obstructing true democratic principles. Manning calls for justice and accountability, advocating for the rights of the common people and their demand for a fair electoral system. His passionate prose seeks to awaken readers to the corrupt practices undermining democracy and urges citizens to fight for their political rights and integrity.
