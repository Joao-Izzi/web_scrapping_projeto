    "resumo": "\"Collectivum\" by Mike Lewis is a science fiction novella that was published in the early 1950s. The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a parasitic alien race known as the Oren, whose collective consciousness threatens the remnants of humanity. The plot follows the journey of the protagonist, Morgan, as he navigates this dangerous landscape, encountering both human and Orenian foes while contemplating issues of individuality and survival.  In the narrative, Morgan, a hardened wanderer, meets Shera, a woman with a troubled past, as they escape the threat of the Oren and their stings that transform humans into a unified hive mind. They both possess strong survival instincts but are driven by different motivations: Morgan aims to resist and harass the Oren, while Shera grapples with her own identity after surviving an Oren encounter. As they team up to fight off Orenians and other threats, they encounter an old man named Hanson, who provides insight and companionship in their struggles against the Oren menace. The tension escalates as Morgan faces the existential dilemma of whether Shera herself has been affected by the Oren, culminating in a confrontation that tests their humanity in a world increasingly devoid of it. The book closes on a haunting note, as the lines between humanity and the Oren blur amid the chaos. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
