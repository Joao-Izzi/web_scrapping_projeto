    "resumo": "\"Histoire du Bas-Empire. Tome 01\" by Charles Le Beau is a historical account written in the early 19th century. This work delves into the history of the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, exploring its decline and the significant events leading to its fall. The topics covered include political developments, historical figures, and the socio-political conditions that defined the era.  The opening of the text introduces the author's intention to chronicle the history of Constantinople and its successors, beginning from a time of relative strength to their eventual downfall under Ottoman conquest. It highlights the complexity of the empire's governance, the challenges posed by both internal strife and external threats from various barbarian groups, and the varying character of emperors like Dioclétien and Galérius. Set against the backdrop of religious transformations, particularly the rise of Christianity, the narrative establishes a framework for understanding the intricate dynamics that led to the ultimate decline of one of history's most influential empires.
