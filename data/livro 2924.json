    "resumo": "\"The Discipline of War\" by John Hasloch Potter is a collection of spiritual addresses written in the early 20th century. This work, prepared for the Lenten season during the backdrop of World War I, explores themes of self-discipline and moral responsibility amid the turmoil of war. Potter seeks to provide guidance for individuals grappling with their faith and duties during a time of significant national distress, emphasizing the importance of prayer, sacrifice, and self-examination.  At the start of the book, the author presents a call for introspection and discipline as essential components of the Lenten experience, particularly in light of the war. He addresses the reader with reflections on the nature of the will, encouraging a conscious effort to align personal desires with divine purpose. Emphasizing the challenges posed by the current circumstances, Potter speaks of the need for increased devotion and prayer, suggesting that the trials of war provide a unique opportunity for personal and spiritual growth. He introduces the concept of God's discipline acting in conjunction with human will, inviting readers to consider the ways in which they can actively cooperate with the divine in their daily lives.
