This collection, likely compiled in the early 20th century, encompasses a range of genres including essays, utopian fiction, and social critiques.

The index features a diverse array of Gilman's works, including her well-known novella \"Herland,\" which imagines a female-only utopia, and her seminal essay \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" which delves into the effects of mental illness exacerbated by societal expectations. Other notable pieces include \"Women and Economics,\" a thorough examination of the economic relationship between genders, and \"Our Androcentric Culture,\" which critiques the male-dominated social structures. Through these writings, Gilman advocates for women's independence and explores the implications of gender roles in society, making her work relevant to contemporary discussions on feminism and equality.
