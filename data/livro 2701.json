    "resumo": "\"A Digit of the Moon: A Hindoo Love Story\" by F. W. Bain is a novel written in the late 19th century. This work presents a rich tapestry of romance woven into the context of Hindu mythology, exploring themes of love and desire through the character of King Süryakánta, who is determined to unravel the mysteries of attraction and the complexities of the female heart. The narrative invites the reader to witness a blend of poetic storytelling and philosophical musings, reflecting on the nuances of human emotion.  The opening of the novel introduces King Süryakánta, a beautiful yet misogynistic monarch who dismisses offers of marriage and the charms of women. His ministers, concerned about the lack of an heir, devise a plan to introduce him to female beauty, but he remains resistant. The plot takes a turn when a painter arrives in the capital, claiming he can awaken the king's interest in women. Upon seeing a portrait of the enchanting Anangarágá, Süryakánta experiences an overwhelming emotional transformation, setting in motion his quest to pursue her. As he embarks on his journey to find the elusive princess, the themes of love, desire, and the philosophical exploration of womanhood emerge, laying the groundwork for a story rich in cultural insights and emotional depth.
