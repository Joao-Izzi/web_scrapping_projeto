    "resumo": "\"Sergeant York And His People\" by Sam K. Cowan is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book focuses on the life of Alvin C. York, a soldier from Tennessee, emphasizing his remarkable achievements during World War I and the legacy of his family and community. The narrative goes beyond military heroism to explore themes of American values, character, and the influences shaping York's identity.  The opening portion introduces us to Alvin York, underscoring his humble origins as a young man from rural Tennessee, untouched by the complexities of the modern world until he enlisted in the war. As York finds himself in the intense battle at Hill No. 223 in the Argonne Forest, the text vividly describes the chaotic environment, the tactical positioning, and York's extraordinary courage as he faces enemy fire. Capturing a battalion of machine gunners single-handedly, York emerges not only as a war hero but also as a representation of the rugged American spirit shaped by his upbringing in the mountains, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of his life and the people from whom he hails.
