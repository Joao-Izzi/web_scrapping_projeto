    "resumo": "\"Mémoires de Fanny Hill, femme de plaisir\" by John Cleland is a novel written in the early 18th century. This work is often regarded as one of the first erotic novels in English literature, exploring themes of sexuality and desire through the eyes of its protagonist, Fanny Hill. The story follows Fanny, a young woman who navigates the complexities of love and pleasure in London’s vibrant and often risqué society.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to an innocent country girl named Fanny Hill, who is drawn into a life of debauchery after being seduced by a cunning brothel keeper. Her journey quickly leads her to the bustling streets of London, where she encounters a range of characters, including wealthy patrons and other courtesans. The opening sets the tone for Fanny's gradual transformation from naivety to an understanding of love and pleasure, as she becomes embroiled in the complex social and moral dynamics of 18th-century London.
