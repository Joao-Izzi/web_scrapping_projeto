    "resumo": "\"Human Leopards: An Account of the Trials of Human Leopards Before the Special Commission Court\" by K. J. Beatty is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work explores the notorious Human Leopard Society, a secretive group in Sierra Leone engaged in murder and cannibalism, particularly focusing on the trials of its members. The text aims to uncover the grim practices of this society and the judicial efforts made to combat its horrific activities.  The opening of the book introduces the dire circumstances surrounding the Human Leopard Society and the Special Commission established to investigate its crimes. It begins with a preface that addresses common questions regarding the society's motivations and the brutal practices that led to the murder of individuals intended for ritual purposes. Through personal reflections and observations, Beatty outlines the complex cultural and sociopolitical contexts of Sierra Leone that contributed to the society's existence, setting the stage for detailed narratives of specific trial cases that follow in the text. The atmosphere is charged with an understanding of both the gruesome traditions of the society and the subsequent legal repercussions faced by those involved.
