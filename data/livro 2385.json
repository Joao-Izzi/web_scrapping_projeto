    "resumo": "\"The Prince of Parthia: A Tragedy\" by Thomas Godfrey is a dramatic play written in the mid-18th century. This work is notable for being the first printed American tragedy and features themes of ambition, betrayal, and the complexities of love and loyalty. Central characters include the noble Arsaces, who is caught between duty and familial tensions, particularly with his jealous brother Vardanes and their ambitious mother, Queen Thermusa.  The opening of the play introduces an air of celebration in the Parthian city of Ctesiphon due to the victorious return of Arsaces from battle. His bravery is lauded by his family and the citizens, but a tension is palpable, especially from Vardanes, who harbors resentment towards Arsaces and plots to undermine him. The Queen is depicted as deeply embittered by the past death of Vonones at the hands of Arsaces, fueling her desire for revenge. This initial act sets the stage for a conflict that will intertwine the lives of the characters through jealousy, ambition, and familial duty, showcasing the complexities that bind them.
