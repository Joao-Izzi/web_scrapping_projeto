    "resumo": "\"Windy McPherson's Son\" by Sherwood Anderson is a novel written in the early 20th century that explores themes of identity, family, and the struggle for dignity in the face of societal expectations. The narrative follows the life of Sam McPherson, a thirteen-year-old boy living in the small Midwestern town of Caxton, Iowa. Sam grapples with the burdens of his father's failures and the desire to carve out a better life for himself against the backdrop of a community steeped in tradition and conformity.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Sam McPherson, who is portrayed as a tall, observant boy with dreams beyond his small town. As he navigates through Caxton, he encounters various figures, including his father, Windy McPherson, an old soldier struggling with the ghosts of his past and his own inflated self-importance. Sam's admiration for John Telfer, a dandy and self-proclaimed artist, and his interactions with townsfolk reveal much about his character and aspirations. The opening reveals a snapshot of life in a corn-shipping town, teeming with insights into the ambitions, relationships, and conflicts that shape both Sam's life and the lives of those around him. The story quickly sets up a contrast between Sam's hopes and the limitations imposed by his family and community. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
