    "resumo": "\"The Happy Hypocrite: A Fairy Tale for Tired Men\" by Sir Max Beerbohm is a novella written during the late 19th century. This allegorical tale delves into themes of identity and transformation through the story of Lord George Hell, a dissolute nobleman who seeks redemption through love. The narrative combines fantastical elements with sharp social commentary, typical of Beerbohm's satirical style, reflecting the era's literary sensibilities.  The story follows Lord George Hell, known for his excesses and bad behavior, who becomes enamored with the innocent and virtuous actress, Jenny Mere. In a desperate bid to win her love, he acquires a saintly mask to hide his true identity and become the man he aspires to be. However, as he experiences genuine love and transformation, the fa√ßade of the mask becomes integral to his new life. The tale culminates in a confrontation with his past when the mask is removed, revealing that his hypocritical disguise reflected true redemption, as Jenny accepts him for who he truly is. Throughout, the novella explores the complexities of love, morality, and self-discovery, ultimately suggesting that true happiness may lie in the authenticity of one's heart rather than societal pretenses.
