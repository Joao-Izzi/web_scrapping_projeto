    "resumo": "\"Dryden's Works Vol. 08 (of 18)\" by John Dryden is a collection of dramatic works and essays written in the late 17th century. This volume specifically includes the comedy \"Amphitryon: or, The Two Sosias,\" among other plays and critical writings. The topics tackled within these pieces range from humorous misunderstandings in love to commentary on theatrical conventions of the time, showcasing Dryden's versatile talent in both comedy and drama.  At the start of \"Amphitryon,\" the play introduces Mercury and Phœbus discussing the affairs of the gods, particularly focusing on Jupiter's desire to seduce Alcmena, the wife of the general Amphitryon. Jupiter plans to take on Amphitryon's appearance so he can fulfill his desires undetected. Meanwhile, the mortal Sosia, Amphitryon’s servant, is sent to deliver news of his lord’s victory, only to encounter confusion as he confronts the impersonating Jupiter. The opening sets up a comedic exploration of identity, deception, and the entanglements of divine and mortal affairs, setting the stage for intrigue and humor as the plot unfolds.
