    "resumo": "\"Quer Durch Borneo\" by Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis is a travelogue and ethnographic account written in the early 20th century. The work documents the author's extensive journeys through the regions of Borneo between the years 1894 and 1900, focusing on observations related to state organization, indigenous cultures, and natural history. Nieuwenhuis's experiences highlight not only the adventures of exploration but also significant insights into the lives, customs, and socio-political dynamics of the various tribes he encounters, particularly the Dajak people.  At the start of the work, Nieuwenhuis reflects on the transitions and preparations related to his expedition, including a stop in Samarinda and meetings with local officials, as well as plans for a journey to Apu Kajan. He details the logistics of organizing his team, procuring supplies, and navigating the rivers of Borneo. The opening sets the stage for the challenges he faces, from managing local relationships to the unpredictable conditions of travel in a dense jungle environment. This segment establishes an engaging context for the ensuing adventures and cultural encounters that will unfold throughout the narrative. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
