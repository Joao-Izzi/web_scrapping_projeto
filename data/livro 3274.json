    "resumo": "\"A Maid at King Alfred's Court: A Story for Girls\" by Lucy Foster Madison is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set in the time of King Alfred, emphasizing themes of courage, survival, and loyalty against the backdrop of the struggle between the Saxons and the invading Danes. The main characters include Egwina, a young girl known for her beauty and talent in music, and her grandfather, Wulfhere, a skilled harper.  At the start of the novel, the narrative follows Wulfhere and Egwina as they navigate through the forest of Wessex, making their way to Winchester with a desire to seek shelter and the protection of King Alfred. The peaceful journey is interrupted by a call for help from another traveler, leading them into a series of encounters with noble youth and maiden, which deepen Egwina's longing for connection. As they reach a monastery, Egwina's bravery comes to the forefront when their journey is threatened by danger, including a robbery by a fellow traveler, Ã†lfric, and the grim realities of Viking raids that escalate throughout the opening chapters. The beginning sets the stage for both personal and larger historical conflicts, immersing readers in a richly woven tale of life in ancient England. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
