    "resumo": "\"Anttonius Putronius eli Antto Puuronen: Ilveilys viidessä näytelmässä\" by Ludvig Holberg is a comedic play written in the early 18th century. The work is a satire that explores themes of education, arrogance, and the clash between intellectualism and common sense, primarily through the character of Anttonius Putronius, who embodies an overzealous scholar's hubris.   The opening of the play introduces various characters, including the protagonist, Anttonius Putronius, and his family, who await his return home from studies in Helsinki. The initial scenes depict the confusion and comical misunderstandings surrounding Putronius's scholarly achievements, particularly his struggles with Latin, and how his family grapples with the implications of his newfound knowledge. Amidst humorous exchanges with figures like the Kanttori (the village cantor) and his father Sipri, the audience witnesses the relationship between academia and rural life, setting a comedic foundation for Putronius's character development and the unfolding conflicts surrounding his intellectual pretensions.
