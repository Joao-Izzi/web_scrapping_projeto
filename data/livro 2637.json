    "resumo": "\"Miscellanea\" by Juliana Horatia Ewing is a collection of stories written in the late 19th century. This compilation showcases Ewing's versatility and creativity in both narrative and storytelling styles, with a blend of whimsical tales, poignant narratives, and ironic observations. The collection includes stories that traverse various themes, such as family dynamics, the supernatural, and moral lessons, reflecting Ewing's literary prowess and her ability to engage a young audience.  The opening of the book features a preface that outlines its purpose as a complete collection of the author’s works, despite her own lack of enthusiasm for some of the included pieces. It discusses her ability to mimic different writing styles and introduces the first story, \"The Mystery of the Bloody Hand.\" This tale is presented as a retrospective account by a character named Dorothy, who recounts her experiences surrounding a harrowing New Year’s Eve dance and the mysterious events that followed, including love, loss, and a troubling incident that may have supernatural implications. The narrative sets the tone for a blend of adventure and emotion, inviting readers to explore the intricacies of human relationships intertwined with elements of mystery.
