    "resumo": "\"Entretiens / Interviews / Entrevistas\" by Marie Lebert is a collection of interviews compiled in the early 21st century. The work features insights and opinions from various professionals in the literary and digital world, including writers, journalists, publishers, and linguists, focusing on their views regarding the Internet, copyright, digital publishing, and the evolving landscape of information and multilingualism. This book brings to light the intersection of literature and technology in an age of rapid digital transformation.  The opening of the book presents a prelude that sets the stage for the interviews to come. It poses critical questions about how professionals engage with the Internet and their perspectives on contemporary issues such as the significance of copyright in a digital era. Interviewees share personal anecdotes regarding their use of digital mediums, their outlook on the future of print versus electronic formats, and reflections on the impact of the information society and multilingual Internet. The beginning establishes a thematic framework for the discussions that will follow, making it clear that the text aims to explore not only professional paths but also the broader cultural implications of the digital shift in literature and communication.
