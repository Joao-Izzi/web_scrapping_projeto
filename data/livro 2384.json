    "resumo": "\"History of the Revolt of the Netherlands — Volume 02\" by Friedrich Schiller is a historical account written during the early 19th century that provides a detailed narrative of the political and social turmoil in the Netherlands during the reign of Philip II of Spain. The book centers around pivotal figures such as Cardinal Granvella, examining his rise to power, political machinations, and the mounting resistance against his oppressive policies from both the nobility and the general populace.  At the start of the narrative, the focus is on Cardinal Granvella, detailing his background and remarkable intellect that allowed him to ascend within the Spanish court. Schiller portrays the turbulent climate in the Netherlands, marked by resistance to Granvella's efforts to enforce Catholic orthodoxy and suppress Protestantism. As dissent grows among the nobility and the populace, the tensions between royal authority and local grievances manifest through various uprisings and political intrigues, setting the stage for further conflict in the ongoing struggle for independence. The opening chapters particularly highlight how Granvella’s domineering and sometimes arrogant administration not only alienated him from many factions but also ignited a widespread desire for change among the Netherlands populace.
