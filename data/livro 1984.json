    "resumo": "\"A libell of Spanish lies : found at the sacke of Cales, discoursing the fight in the West INDIES, twixt the English Nauie being fourteene Ships and Pinasses, and a fleete of twentie saile of the king of Spaines, and of the death of Sir Francis Drake.\" by Henrie Sauile is a historical account written in the late 16th century. The book delves into the naval conflicts between the English and Spanish fleets during a critical time in maritime history, specifically the battles surrounding the West Indies and the narratives constructed around Sir Francis Drake's controversial death.  In this text, Henrie Sauile refutes the claims made by Don Bernaldino Delgadillo, a Spanish fleet commander, after his letters celebrated supposed victories over the English. Sauile provides a detailed counter-narrative defending the English perspective and recounting the actual events of the encounters, asserting the honor and valor of the English sailors despite the Spanish commanderâ€™s misleading assertions. The book serves not only to clear the air surrounding the truth of these historical events but also to honor the legacy of Sir Francis Drake and others involved, showcasing a confrontation of pride between the two maritime powers of the time.
