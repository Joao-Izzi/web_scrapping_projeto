    "resumo": "\"Wages in 1873: Address read before the Social Science Association at Norwich\" by Thomas Brassey, M.P. is a historical address delivered in the early 1870s. This scientific publication discusses the significant rise in wages during the time, reflecting the socio-economic conditions of the late 19th century. The document primarily explores the labor movement in England, the impact of economic recovery on wage increases, and the role of labor unions in negotiating wages.  In his address, Brassey emphasizes that the rise in wages is predominantly due to the increased demand for labor following a period of industrial growth, rather than the result of successful strikes or union negotiations. He analyzes the failure of a notable miners' strike in South Wales, arguing that well-organized employers can withstand such movements when the economic conditions are unfavorable to labor. The address also covers topics such as the rising costs of coal, the challenges of shorter work hours, and the potential for cooperatives among workers. Through a detailed examination, Brassey highlights the complexities within labor relations, advocating for informed economic actions rather than reliance on strikes, and calls for increased productivity to secure better wages in the long term.
