    "resumo": "\"Books and Their Makers during the Middle Ages\" by Geo. Haven Putnam is a historical account likely written in the late 19th century. This work examines the conditions surrounding the production and distribution of literature from the fall of the Roman Empire to the close of the Seventeenth Century. The focus is on the role of printer-publishers, their impact on literary culture, and the evolution of the book trade during this pivotal era.  The opening of the book presents a preface detailing the significance of the printing press in increasing the availability of literature and influencing thought, particularly during the Reformation. Putnam explains how the accessibility of printed works contributed to a wider reading public, shifting the dynamics from exclusive scholarly circles to a more general audience. The discussion emphasizes the interplay between publishers and political or ecclesiastical authorities, highlighting how censorship affected the creation and distribution of literary works. Overall, the beginning sets the stage for an exploration of the emergence of a vibrant book culture shaped by socio-political forces. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
