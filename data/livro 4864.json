    "resumo": "\"La Città dell'Oro\" by Emilio Salgari is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story begins with two cousins, Alonzo and Raffaele, who are hunters in the mysterious and lush jungles of South America, specifically near the Orenoco River. They encounter a fierce jaguar during a hunting expedition, which serves as an early test of their courage, leading to a surprising meeting with a proud Indian named Yaruri who offers them a chance for adventure and riches.  At the start of the narrative, the cousins are caught in a perilous situation as they hunt jaguars in the dense jungle, highlighting their bravery and the dangers that await them. After a dramatic encounter with the jaguar, they are saved by the intervention of Yaruri, who claims he can lead them to the legendary city of gold, Manoa. This city is steeped in myth and has captivated the imaginations of explorers for centuries. The opening establishes both the thrilling settings of the jungle and the promise of adventure, intrigue, and potential danger as the cousins consider following Yaruri deeper into the wilderness, motivated by the legends of untold riches.
