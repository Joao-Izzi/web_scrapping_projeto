    "resumo": "\"Epidemic Respiratory Disease\" by Eugene L. Opie, M.D., and collaborators is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the pneumonias and infections of the respiratory tract that accompanied influenza and measles during a notable epidemic. The book likely serves as a detailed account of the disease's epidemiology, clinical features, and underlying pathology, drawing on extensive observational studies conducted among military personnel during a significant influenza outbreak.  The opening of the book discusses the alarming mortality rates from pneumonia in the army during World War I, particularly focusing on Camp Funston. It describes how a commission was assigned to study pneumonia cases and their correlation with influenza outbreaks, marking the timeline of these events. Key observations were made regarding the types of pneumococci present in patients, highlighting the unique circumstances of the pneumonia observed among recently drafted troops. The introduction sets the stage for a detailed investigation of the bacteriology, clinical features, and pathology of infections resulting from this global health crisis.
