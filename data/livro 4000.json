    "resumo": "\"The Long Day: The Story of a New York Working Girl, as Told by Herself\" is an autobiographical narrative written in the early 20th century. The book chronicles the experiences of a young woman who moves to New York City in search of work and a better life, facing the harsh realities of the urban environment as she navigates loneliness, financial instability, and the struggles common to working girls of that era. The main character, a friendless and almost penniless girl of eighteen, represents the many individuals seeking to establish themselves in a challenging new world.  The opening of the narrative introduces the protagonist waking up in a dreary boarding house room on a rainy morning in New York City. The memory of her recent journey to the city—a mix of grandeur and nostalgia for her rural past—sets the tone for her struggles ahead. She quickly recalls her dire situation: lonely and without means, she faces the necessity of finding work. As she navigates her new reality at Miss Elmira Jamison's boarding house, she is introduced to other colorful characters, including potential friends, while grappling with her own feelings of homesickness and the urgency of job searching in a bustling, indifferent metropolis. The opening establishes her resilience and determination as she embarks on this challenging chapter of her life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
