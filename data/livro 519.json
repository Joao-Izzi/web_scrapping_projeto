    "resumo": "\"Home Again, Home Again\" by Cory Doctorow is a science fiction short story originally published in 1999 and later included in the collection \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" released in the early 2000s. The narrative explores themes of identity and alienation through the lens of a futuristic society where humans, often seen as unfit, are placed in mental institutions by extraterrestrial beings. The protagonist, Chet, navigates this complex world, grappling with feelings of betrayal and a deep sense of longing for connection and belonging.  The story follows Chet, a young boy living in a dilapidated high-rise known colloquially as the \"bat-house,\" where he and his neighbors face psychological turmoil due to their perceived 'batty' behavior. Chet's experience is marked by his interactions with The Amazing Robotron, a robotic counselor, and a mysterious man convinced he is Nikola Tesla. As Chet attempts to understand himself and those around him, the constraints of his environment lead him to explore troubling thoughts about family, friendship, and his own sanity. Ultimately, the narrative crescendos to a dramatic, poignant climax, showcasing Chetâ€™s emotional journey and the severe consequences of being discarded by society, thus raising critical questions about the nature of humanity and the cost of being \"normal.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
