    "resumo": "\"Myths of China and Japan\" by Donald A. Mackenzie is a scholarly exploration of the mythologies rooted in the cultures of China and Japan, likely written in the early 20th century. This volume aims to provide insights into the origins and evolution of these civilizations, delving into the intertwining influences from across ancient cultures and the complexities of their belief systems. The book seeks to unravel how cultural ideas have spread and merged over time, shaping the rich tapestry of myths in the Far East.  The opening of the volume lays a comprehensive foundation for understanding the significance of mythology within Chinese and Japanese cultures, revealing the interconnectedness of their respective mythologies with other ancient civilizations. It discusses the consequences of cultural contact and exchange, illustrating how myths are not isolated but rather products of a broader human experience that transcends geographical boundaries. Mackenzie critiques the notion of complete cultural isolation in China and Japan, emphasizing that many beliefs, practices, and symbols found in these cultures have evolved through the assimilation of ideas from diverse influences, suggesting that a thoughtful examination of mythology ultimately reflects the shared heritage of humanity.
