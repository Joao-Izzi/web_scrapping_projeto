    "resumo": "\"Cousin Henry\" by Anthony Trollope is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the complex relationships and moral dilemmas faced by its main characters, particularly Isabel Brodrick and her Uncle Indefer Jones amidst the backdrop of estate inheritance and duty. The tension arises from Uncle Indefer’s struggle to pass his property, Llanfeare, to his nephew, Henry Jones, while Isabel is resolute in refusing to marry her cousin, whom she despises, leading to familial conflicts and questions of conscience.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Uncle Indefer and Isabel as they engage in a philosophical conversation about duty, love, and the dilemmas of inheritance. Uncle Indefer’s intentions for the estate and concerns about its future create a backdrop of tension, particularly as he desires to secure it for his nephew, despite Isabel's strong opposition to the marriage. Relationships unearth the complexities of familial loyalty, as Isabel wrestles with her feelings towards Henry and her duty to her uncle, setting the stage for the unfolding drama surrounding the family and its legacy. The dialogue and character development in these early chapters hint at the emotional and ethical conflicts that will drive the narrative forward. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
