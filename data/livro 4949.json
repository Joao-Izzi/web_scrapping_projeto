    "resumo": "\"The Two Great Retreats of History\" by George Grote and comte de Philippe-Paul Ségur is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work focuses on two significant military retreats: the Retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks after the death of Cyrus the Younger and Napoleon's Retreat from Moscow. Through detailed narratives, the book explores themes of leadership, survival, and the dynamics of power in ancient Persian and early 19th-century contexts, highlighting the resilience and determination of the soldiers involved.  At the start of the narrative, the attention is drawn to the background of Cyrus the Younger, the Persian prince whose ambitions lead to the pivotal conflict at Kunaxa. The opening section describes the initial stages of the Greek mercenaries' journey under Cyrus, detailing their motivations and the unfolding events that lead to their unexpected situation after his death. As the Greeks grapple with their desolate predicament in enemy territory, they face numerous challenges, including dwindling supplies and the threat of the Persian forces. The selections from Grote and Ségur set the stage for exploring not only the external challenges faced by the troops but also the internal dynamics and experiences that define their journey towards home and survival.
