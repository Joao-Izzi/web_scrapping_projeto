    "resumo": "\"De Abbé Constantijn\" by Ludovic Halévy is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the titular character, Abbé Constantijn, an elderly priest who grapples with the sale of the Longueval estate that has been in the family for generations. This sale marks not only a change in ownership but also a significant shift in the relationships and traditions surrounding the parish and the community he has dedicated his life to.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to Abbé Constantijn as he walks along the dusty road leading to the village of Longueval, contemplating the impending auction of the estate. The death of the long-time benefactor, La Marquise de Longueval, has led to the necessity of selling off the land, deeply affecting the priest who has cultivated a bond with it over thirty years. The narrative elaborates on the personal loss he feels as he reflects on the previous kindnesses extended by the Marquise and his concerns about the potential new owners, foreshadowing conflict between his values and the changes to come with the arrival of the new, wealthy, and likely less charitable proprietors.
