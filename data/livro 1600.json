    "resumo": "\"The Best of the World's Classics, Restricted to Prose. Volume II (of X) - Rome\" is a collection edited by Henry Cabot Lodge, likely written during the early 20th century. This anthology shares notable prose from significant Roman authors, accompanied by biographical and explanatory notes, shedding light on the thoughts and values of ancient Rome through selected works by figures such as Cicero, Cato, and Caesar. The topics discussed range from philosophy and poetry to historical accounts, reflecting the rich literary heritage of Roman civilization.  The opening of this volume presents various excerpts that highlight not only the practical aspects of Roman life, such as agriculture in Cato's writings, but also philosophical musings on old age and friendship by Cicero. Cato emphasizes proper stewardship of land and slaves, advocating for diligence and accountability in agricultural practices. Meanwhile, Cicero's reflections explore the benefits of old age and the enduring nature of friendship, illustrating Roman values of virtue, wisdom, and societal duty. This introductory portion establishes a foundation for appreciating how these intertwined themes contribute to the broader understanding of the Roman experience.
