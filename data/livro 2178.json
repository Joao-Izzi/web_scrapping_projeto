    "resumo": "\"Les grandes journées de la Constituante\" by Albert Mathiez is a historical account written during the early 20th century. The book focuses on pivotal events during the French Revolution, particularly the formation of the National Assembly and the actions leading up to the Revolution itself. It delves deeply into the tensions between the various social orders and the political maneuvers that defined this revolutionary period.  The opening of the book presents the critical moment when the Third Estate, feeling marginalized by the monarchy, proclaimed itself the National Assembly on June 17, 1789, signaling its intent to challenge the existing power structures. It sets the stage with a recount of the assembly's defiance against royal orders, culminating in the famous Tennis Court Oath taken by representatives vowing not to disband until a new constitution was established. The narrative introduces the escalating conflicts between the assembly and the king's forces, hinting at the brewing revolutionary spirit among the populace, as well as the solidarity formed among the members of the National Assembly. Overall, this beginning lays the groundwork for understanding the complexities and struggles that drove the French Revolution forward. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
