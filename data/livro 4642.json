    "resumo": "\"Nicht der Mörder, der Ermordete ist schuldig: Eine Novelle\" by Franz Werfel is a novella written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the complex relationship between a young boy named Karl and his father, whose strict and harsh demeanor shapes Karl's troubled childhood and later life. It explores themes of authority, parental expectations, and the quest for identity against the backdrop of military life.  At the start of the novella, we are introduced to Karl, a cadet enduring the harsh realities of a military academy while grappling with his complex feelings toward his domineering father, an officer. As he recounts his Sundays spent in fear and anxiety under his father's critical eye, the narrative delves into Karl's bittersweet memories of yearning for affection from his parents, particularly highlighting the contrast between his father’s authoritative presence and his mother’s silent struggle. During a poignant birthday outing, Karl's deep-seated resentment and longing collide, culminating in a tragic incident that foreshadows the ongoing emotional turmoil that will deeply affect his future.
