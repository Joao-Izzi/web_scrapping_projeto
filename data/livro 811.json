    "resumo": "\"Sappho : Ein Trauerspiel in fünf Aufzügen\" by Franz Grillparzer is a dramatic play written during the early 19th century. The story revolves around the legendary poet Sappho and her tumultuous relationship with Phaon, exploring themes of love, betrayal, and the conflicts between personal desire and societal expectations.   The opening of the play introduces Sappho as she returns to her home in Lesbos, celebrated and crowned for her poetic prowess, which she sees as a burden related to her artistry rather than a cause forjoy. As she is welcomed by her people, her close servant Rhamnes prepares for her arrival while expressing concern that Sappho should relish the attention. The atmosphere is filled with anticipation as Sappho declares her love for Phaon, who is portrayed as a young man of humble beginnings. The scene is set for conflict, as Sappho becomes emotionally intertwined with Phaon’s eventual affection for a younger servant, Melitta, highlighting the themes of love that are both passionate and painful. This initial setup hints at Sappho's internal struggles and foreshadows the unfolding drama related to her feelings of jealousy and inadequacy. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
