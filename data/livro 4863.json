    "resumo": "\"Sämtliche Werke 7-8: Der Jüngling\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers on Arkádi Makárowitsch Dolgorúki, a young man grappling with his identity, social status, and the concept of personal power in the wake of his illegitimate birth. The novel delves into themes of existentialism, morality, and the quest for meaning in a rapidly changing society.  At the start of the narrative, the protagonist introduces himself, revealing his complex family background as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Andreí Petrówitsch Werssíloff. Dolgorúki reflects on his childhood, his disdain for his family name, and the emotional turmoil of not having a stable relationship with his natural father, who largely abandoned him. The opening sets the stage for his inner struggle as he decides to carve his path, disregarding societal expectations and attempting to pursue a profound personal idea. The feelings of isolation, ambition, and conflict with his heritage are established, hinting at the intense psychological exploration that characterizes Dostoyevsky's work.
