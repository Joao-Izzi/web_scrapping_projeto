    "resumo": "\"Women in Modern Industry\" by B. L. Hutchins is a socio-economic treatise written in the early 20th century. The work examines the historical, social, and economic dynamics of women's roles in the labor force, particularly in relation to the industrial revolution and its ongoing effects. The central focus is on the position of working women, their wages, and the evolving societal perceptions surrounding their contributions to industry.  The opening of the text provides a comprehensive preface in which the author outlines the objectives and framework of the book. Hutchins explains the necessity of studying the employment of women in the context of significant historical events, such as the industrial revolution and World War I. She emphasizes that the growth of women's labor has long been overlooked and that despite the complexity of their roles in the workforce, women have increasingly become essential economic contributors. Furthermore, Hutchins acknowledges her reliance on various sources and previous studies while outlining her approach to addressing the challenges and expectations of women workers in modern society.
