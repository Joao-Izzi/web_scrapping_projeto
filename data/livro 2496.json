    "resumo": "\"The Battle and the Ruins of Cintla\" by Daniel G. Brinton is an archaeological account published in the late 19th century. This scholarly work explores the historical significance of the Battle of Cintla, which marked the first military engagement involving horses on the American continent during Hernando Cortés' expedition in March 1519. The book provides an examination of both the battle itself and the ruins believed to be situated at the location of the confrontation, investigating the indigenous culture and the significance of the event in the context of early colonial history.  In this account, Brinton delves into the battle between the European troops led by Cortés and the native Maya tribes. He recounts the events leading to the engagement, detailing Cortés’ preparations and the opposition faced from the indigenous warriors. The narrative describes the native settlement—Potonchan—and our understanding of its name, linking it to a Mayan language. Brinton also discusses the archaeological remnants found near Cintla, emphasizing the cultural and historical richness of the area, the agricultural practices of its inhabitants, and the advanced civilization before the Spanish conquest. Overall, the texto provides valuable insights into early encounters between European colonizers and indigenous peoples in America, alongside archaeological observations that enhance our understanding of the region's past.
