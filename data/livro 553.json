    "resumo": "\"King John\" by William Shakespeare is a historical play written during the late 16th century. The story revolves around the reign of King John of England, his conflicts with France, and the intricate dynamics of power, legitimacy, and family, particularly concerning his nephew, Arthur, Duke of Brittany, and other nobility in England and France.   At the start of the play, political tensions are immediately apparent as King John receives an embassy from France, laying claim to the English throne on behalf of his deceased brother's son, Arthur. This claim raises the specter of war, prompting discussions between key characters, including John's mother, Queen Eleanor, and various nobles about loyalty, revenge, and the implications of usurped titles. A subplot involves the relationship between John and the Bastard Faulconbridge, who grapples with his identity and legitimacy, as he claims his half-brother's estate and navigates his role in the unfolding political drama. The opening sets a tone of conflict, foreshadowing the tragic events and moral dilemmas that will envelop the characters as the plot progresses. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
