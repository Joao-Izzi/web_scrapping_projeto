    "resumo": "\"The Boss of Little Arcady\" by Harry Leon Wilson is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around the comically dysfunctional life in the small town of Little Arcady, showcasing the antics of its absurdly unwelcome inhabitant, Colonel J. Rodney Potts, and the townspeople's schemes to rid themselves of him.   The opening of the novel introduces us to Colonel Potts, a braggart and obnoxious figure whose presence the townspeople wish to escape. The townsfolk, led by the editor Solon Denney, concoct a humorous plan to convince Potts to leave by flattering him and gifting him money to start anew in a larger town. Through witty commentary and irony, the narrative explores themes of social dynamics, identity, and the absurdities of human behavior as the plot unfolds the unintended consequences of their scheme. The portrayal of the townspeople, with their various personalities and motivations, sets the stage for a lively exploration of community life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
