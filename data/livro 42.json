    "resumo": "\"Ylhäiset ja alhaiset\" by K. J. Gummerus is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story appears to center around the life of a peasant family living in a small, remote homestead called Metsämaa, grappling with the harsh realities of nature, poverty, and unfulfilled expectations in an agricultural society. Key characters mentioned include Jaakko, the father, Eeva, the mother, and their youngest son, Johannes, who is too innocent at the start to fully understand the struggles of their lives.  The opening of the novel introduces the setting, a peasant's dwelling amidst a shadowy forest, where the land has been devastated by frost for five consecutive years. The family members express their hope for a change in fortune with the arrival of spring and the lifting of the frost, which has brought great hardships. As they anticipate a bountiful harvest, the despair of failing crops looms, suggesting the title's juxtaposition of the upper and lower classes. As the narrative unfolds, the devastating effects of another frost are revealed, leading to discussions among the family about survival and the loss of their livestock. The beginning sets a tone of the cyclical struggle between hope and despair, highlighting the family's resilience amidst adversity. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
