    "resumo": "\"The Sorceress, v. 3 of 3\" by Mrs. Oliphant is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative unfolds around Charlie Kingsward, a young man struggling with disappointment and feelings of despair after a rejection by a woman he cares for. As Charlie grapples with his emotions, we see the impacts of his actions on his family, particularly his father, Colonel Kingsward, and his sister, Bee, who are both left in a state of worry and confusion regarding his whereabouts.  The beginning of the novel introduces Charlie’s rush to escape from Oxford after experiencing a deep emotional crisis, compounded by humiliation from a romantic rejection. As he escapes to London, his sense of direction and purpose seems lost, symbolizing the chaos he feels inside. His family’s growing concern becomes evident, particularly through Bee's reflections on their brother's distress and her own tumult of feelings regarding Aubrey Leigh, who also seems to be affected by Charlie’s situation. The bustling outside world contrasts sharply with Charlie's haunting solitude, setting the stage for a story that explores themes of love, loss, and familial bonds amidst turmoil.
