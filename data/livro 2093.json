    "resumo": "\"Idonia: A Romance of Old London\" by Arthur Frederick Wallis is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative revolves around Denis Cleeve, a young man navigating familial ties and the complexities of loyalty, particularly in relation to his enigmatic uncle Botolph and the shadow of events tied to treason and personal betrayal. Throughout the story, themes of honor, duty, and adventure intertwine as Denis grapples with his identity and future in a richly rendered historical setting.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Denis Cleeve's childhood, marked by a distant relationship with his father and a budding curiosity about the world beyond his home. The narrative sets the stage for his adventures as he learns about the existence of his uncle, Botolph, and the strained family dynamics that stem from their shared past. The youthful Denis is portrayed as dreamily caught up in aspirations of heroism, influenced by the dramatic tales of his friend Simon. As he prepares to leave his quiet life behind for the bustling streets of London, readers gain insights into the personal challenges that will shape his journey and hopefully lead to understanding his family's tumultuous history.
