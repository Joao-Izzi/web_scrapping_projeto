    "resumo": "\"Her Own Way\" by Eglanton Thorne is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around Juliet Tracy, a headstrong and defiant young woman from a modest background who struggles to find her place in a world governed by societal expectations. As her older sisters, Hannah and Salome, seek to instill in her a sense of duty and propriety, Juliet's impulsive nature and desire for independence lead her towards a potentially troublesome friendship with the unconventional Flossie Chalcombe.  The opening of the book introduces the Tracy family dynamic, highlighting the tensions between Juliet and her sisters, who are more responsible and conservative in their views. Mrs. Tracy appears caught between her affection for her daughter's free-spirited nature and the societal pressures that dictate how a young woman should behave. As Juliet arrives home late after spending time with Flossie, the narrative showcases her charm and recklessness, leading to conflicts within the household. The reader is set up to witness Juliet's journey, her defiance against her sisters' expectations, and the ensuing consequences of her actions, particularly as she faces the prospect of becoming a governess against her will.
