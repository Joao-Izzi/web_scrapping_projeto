    "resumo": "\"The Myth of the Birth of the Hero: A Psychological Interpretation of Mythology\" by Dr. Otto Rank is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. This work explores the common themes found in hero birth myths across various cultures, aiming to interpret them through a psychological lens. Rank delves into the universal similarities and motifs in these myths, suggesting that they reflect deep-seated psychological phenomena shared by humanity.  At the start of the text, the author introduces the concept of hero myths, highlighting that they often share fantastical elements, despite originating in different civilizations. He discusses various theories that attempt to explain the widespread presence of these myths, addressing ideas of elementary thoughts, original community influences, and the theory of migration. Following this exposition, Rank begins to outline key examples of hero birth myths, including stories of Sargon, Moses, Karna, Å’dipus, and others, showcasing their shared narrative structures and motifs, such as abandonment and miraculous survival, as a foundation for further psychological analysis.
