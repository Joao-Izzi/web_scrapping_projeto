    "resumo": "\"Our Revolution: Essays on Working-Class and International Revolution, 1904-1917\" by Leon Trotsky is a collection of political essays written in the early 20th century. The work explores the dynamics of the Russian Revolution and the role of the proletariat in achieving political and social change. It focuses on Trotsky's revolutionary theories, particularly his belief in the necessity of the working class as the driving force behind the revolution and the establishment of a socialist state.  The opening of the book provides a preface written by Moissaye J. Olgin, who introduces Trotsky as a significant thinker and leader within the revolutionary movement, emphasizing the global importance of Russia's struggles. Olgin discusses the lack of understanding the world has had regarding Russian revolutionists and highlights the intense ideological development that has occurred among them over decades. Trotsky's essays aim to clarify these ideas and to mobilize the working class towards revolution, stressing the significance of active engagement and leadership in shaping the future of Russia and potentially, the world.
