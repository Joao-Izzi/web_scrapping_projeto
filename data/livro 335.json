    "resumo": "\"A Sermon Preach'd upon the Occasion of the Anniversary Thanksgiving of the Fifth of November, 1706\" by NATH. HOUGH is a religious sermon written in the early 18th century. This text is presented as a commemoration of the significance of November 5th, reflecting on the theme of divine providence in protecting England from conspiratorial threats, particularly those associated with Catholic attempts to undermine Protestant rule.   In the sermon, Hough recounts the historical context of the Gunpowder Plot and emphasizes the importance of gratitude towards God for the deliverance from such a perilous scheme. He draws upon Psalm 124 to articulate the idea that without divine intervention, the nation would have faced devastation. Hough elaborates on the cruelty of the conspiracy, the precariousness of England's situation at the time, and encourages his audience to remember both past and present blessings. He emphasizes that recognizing these deliverances is crucial to maintaining faith and appreciation for God's role in history, positioning the thanksgiving as a vital part of national identity and spiritual observance.
