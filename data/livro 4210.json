    "resumo": "\"Origine della lingua italiana: dissertazione\" by Luigi Morandi is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This work delves into the origins and development of the Italian language, discussing its relation to other Romance languages and the influences that have shaped it over time.  At the start of the dissertazione, the author disputes the book's title, asserting that the term \"Italian language\" can be misleading. Morandi explores the complexities of defining what constitutes the Italian language, contrasting written forms with spoken dialects across various regions of Italy. He introduces the idea that all Romance languages share a common origin in Latin, setting the stage for a deeper examination of the evolution of Italian as a distinct linguistic entity, influenced by various historical and social factors.
