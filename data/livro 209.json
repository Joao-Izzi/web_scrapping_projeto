    "resumo": "\"Tabitha at Ivy Hall\" by Ruth Alberta Brown is a children's novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers on a spirited young girl named Tabitha Catt, who grapples with the challenges of her unusual name while longing for acceptance and friendship in her new home. As she navigates her relationships with her stern father, her kind-hearted brother Tom, and a new world of acquaintances, her journey unfolds within a backdrop of both internal and external conflicts involving identity and self-worth.   The opening of the narrative introduces us to Tabitha’s fierce character, as we witness her anger towards a teasing boy and her impulsive nature in dealing with her adversaries. We learn of her father’s strictness, which complicates their relationship and culminates in her struggles with feelings of inadequacy stemming from her name. Amidst her tumultuous emotions, she devises an elaborate new identity, the long and regal \"Theodora Marcella Gabrielle Julianna Victoria Emeline,\" highlighting her imaginative spirit and her desire for respect. This portion sets the stage for her challenges in dealing with her identity, fostering friendships, and finding her place in the world, as she ultimately seeks to break free from the burdens of being a 'Tabby Catt.'
