    "resumo": "\"Molemmat kuurot: Ilveily yhdessä näytöksessä\" by Jules Moinaux is a comedic play written in the late 19th century. The narrative centers around the theme of communication barriers, specifically focusing on the lives of two deaf characters and the humorous situations that arise from their inability to hear. This exploration of misunderstandings and social interactions speaks to the broader human experience of connection and the challenges that can inhibit it.  The play unfolds in a domestic setting where the character Tarkia, who has been deaf for three years, is oblivious to the romantic tensions between his daughter Engla and a young man named Arvid. Engla longs for companionship, but Tarkia has been rejecting all marriage proposals for her, having his own ideal of a son-in-law. In a series of humorous miscommunications, Arvid pretends to be deaf to win Tarkia's approval. As the story progresses, both Tarkia and Arvid struggle with their identities and perceptions, leading to laughter and chaos. Ultimately, the twist occurs when Tarkia unexpectedly regains his hearing, revealing the deeper threads of love and acceptance as he learns of his daughter's true feelings for Arvid. The play cleverly intertwines comedy and romance, showcasing the importance of understanding in relationships. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
