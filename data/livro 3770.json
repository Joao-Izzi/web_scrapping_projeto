    "resumo": "\"Mémoires Posthumes de Braz Cubas\" by Machado de Assis is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative follows the posthumous reflections of the main character, Braz Cubas, a deceased author reflecting on his life, social conventions, and the human condition with a blend of irony and melancholy. This unique perspective allows for a critical exploration of society, mortality, and the whimsical nature of existence.   At the start of the novel, the protagonist, Braz Cubas, introduces himself after having died at the age of sixty-four. He humorously contemplates his death and the subsequent nature of his memories, stating that he prefers to begin with his death rather than his birth, which distinguishes his memoirs as unique. He describes his final moments and reflects on life, death, and the absurdity of human aspirations, while hinting at a more significant philosophical exploration that connects the personal with the universal. Braz's narrative style is whimsical and philosophical, providing insight into his character and setting the stage for a deeper narrative that explores themes of memory, identity, and societal critique.
