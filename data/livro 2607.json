    "resumo": "\"Lay Help the Church's Present Need\" by William Baird is a religious discourse written in the late 19th century. This work addresses the urgent need for lay participation in church activities, emphasizing the essential role of lay helpers in serving the community and extending the church's mission. Through his paper, Baird highlights the historical context and biblical foundations for lay involvement, using these to advocate for active service among all church members.  In this paper, Baird discusses the critical importance of lay participation in church life, arguing that previous successful periods within the church were marked by strong lay activity. He draws from ecclesiastical history to illustrate how lay helpers have always played a vital role in ministering to the needs of both the church and the wider community. The text calls for the establishment of organized lay help, encouraging church members to personally engage in community service and spiritual outreach. Baird also recognizes current challenges, including the disconnect between clergy and laity, and proposes solutions for enhancing collaboration that could benefit both the church and society. The overarching message is a call to action for all individuals to take up the responsibility of service to foster a vibrant church presence in contemporary society.
