    "resumo": "\"The Impossible Voyage Home\" by F. L. Wallace is a science fiction novel written in the mid-20th century. It explores themes of space travel, aging, and the human condition, all set against the backdrop of a future where the challenges of interplanetary travel are influenced by the effects of radiation and biological limitations. The story centers on the concepts of heredity and human resilience amidst the harsh realities of space.  The narrative follows the elderly couple, Ethan and Amantha, as they long to see their youngest grandchild on Earth. With a limited time frame due to the constraints of aging and space travel, they hatch a plan to steal a spaceship to make the journey home. As they unexpectedly succeed in piloting the craft through their combined experiences and sheer determination, their adventure illuminates the depth of their bond and the wisdom accumulated over a lifetime. Along the way, they confront both the physical challenges posed by space and societal perceptions of the elderly, ultimately rediscovering their agency and capabilities, much to the surprise of those who doubted them. The book culminates in a realization of the potential within those often overlooked due to age, and presents a thought-provoking exploration of what it means to truly live and connect with oneâ€™s family.
