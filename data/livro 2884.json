    "resumo": "\"Studies in Early Victorian Literature\" by Frederic Harrison is a scholarly collection of essays written in the late 19th century. The work provides a critical examination of the literary contributions made by key authors during the early Victorian period, focusing on the social influences and characteristics that defined this era's literature. Through detailed analysis, Harrison aims to articulate the evolution of thought and literary expression in the context of the significant social and political changes occurring in England during Queen Victoria's reign.  The opening of the book sets the tone for Harrison's exploration of Victorian literature. It starts with an introduction that outlines the fundamental characteristics of literature produced during this dynamic period, emphasizing the age's complexity and uniqueness. Harrison contrasts early Victorian literature with that of previous eras, reflecting on the lack of a single dominant figure akin to Shakespeare or Milton. He suggests that this period is marked by its diverse forms and voices, driven by a strong sociological perspective which influences thematic content, style, and the preoccupations of the time. The reader is presented with the idea that the richness of this literature stems from its engagement with pressing social issues, ultimately paving the way for discussions of significant figures such as Carlyle, Thackeray, and Dickens in the subsequent essays.
