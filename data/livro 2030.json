    "resumo": "\"The Mermaid's Prophecy, and Other Songs Relating to Queen Dagmar\" by George Borrow is a collection of poetic narratives written in the early 20th century. The book delves into the legends and folklore surrounding Queen Dagmar of Denmark, exploring themes of love, sacrifice, and the supernatural within a historical context. Borrow weaves these tales in a lyrical style, drawing on the rich tableau of medieval Scandinavian history.  The collection features various songs that recount the romantic wooing of King Valdemar of Denmark and his beautiful bride Dagmar, as well as the haunting tale of a mermaid whose fate is intertwined with the royal family. In \"King Valdemar's Wooing,\" the king sends an envoy to Bohemia to claim Dagmar's hand, leading to a series of courtly exchanges and celebrations. In contrast, \"The Mermaid's Prophecy\" tells of a mermaid trapped and compelled to reveal dark truths, shedding light on the tensions between desire and duty. Throughout the verses, we see Queen Dagmar portrayed as a compassionate ruler who strives to balance her love for her husband with her responsibilities to her people, ultimately making significant sacrifices in the name of love and duty.
