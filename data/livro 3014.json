    "resumo": "\"Mike Fletcher: A Novel\" by George Moore is a novel written in the late 19th century. The book appears to explore themes of love, ambition, and moral conflict through the experiences of its main characters, especially Mike Fletcher and John Norton, as they navigate the complexities of life and relationships in a vibrant yet morally ambiguous London.   The opening of the novel introduces a lively scene in a restaurant where Mike Fletcher socializes with acquaintances and engages in raucous banter, reflecting the bohemian lifestyle of the time. We meet John Norton, who grapples with his ideals in contrast to the societal distractions around him, particularly the allure of women and the insidious influence of Mike, who is both charming and debauched. As the narrative unfolds, deeper philosophical discussions arise regarding love, virtue, and temptation, particularly as John becomes increasingly concerned about the fate of a nun, Lily Young, whom Mike has lured from her convent. The tension builds as personal desires clash with ethical considerations, drawing the reader into the moral dilemmas that define these charactersâ€™ lives.
