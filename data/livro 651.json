    "resumo": "\"Yellow Star: A Story of East and West\" by Elaine Goodale Eastman is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story follows a young Indian girl named Stella, also known as Yellow Star, as she navigates her new life after being adopted by a white family in a small New England town. The novel explores themes of identity, belonging, cultural intersection, and the struggles Stella faces as she attempts to fit into a world that is often foreign and unwelcoming to her heritage.  The opening portion of the novel introduces readers to the quaint village of Laurel, where Stella's future unfolds amidst the acceptance and challenges of her new community. Young Stella arrives from Dakota to live with the warm-hearted but somewhat rigid Mrs. Waring and her cold sister, Miss Sophia. As Stella prepares to enter school, her initial excitement is marred by concerns of how she will be treated by her classmates. The narrative weaves between her longing for acceptance and the prejudices she may face as an indigenous girl in a predominantly white setting, setting the stage for the rich exploration of her identity that follows.
