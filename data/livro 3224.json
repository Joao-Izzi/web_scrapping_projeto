    "resumo": "\"Navaho Houses\" by Cosmos Mindeleff is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. The work delves into the architectural styles and construction methods of the Navaho Indians, focusing on the traditional hogáns (houses) that serve as the focal point of their cultural identity. The book is aimed at students of architecture, archaeology, and ethnology, offering insights into the way these structures reflect the people's mental and industrial status throughout their history.  The opening of \"Navaho Houses\" introduces the topic of the unique dwelling structures of the Navaho people, emphasizing their significance in understanding the tribe's culture and lifestyle. Mindeleff outlines the intention behind the account and notes the contemporary pressures facing traditional building practices, suspecting that these may soon be lost due to modern influences. He highlights the historical context of house construction, including the use of specific materials and ceremonial dedication practices that accompany the building of hogáns. The narrative sets the foundation for a detailed exploration of various types of houses, including winter hogáns, summer shelters, and sweat houses, as well as the environmental and cultural factors that influence this architecture.
