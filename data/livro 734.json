The story revolves around Lady Windermere, whose marriage is put to the test when rumors surface about her husband's friendship with a notorious woman named Mrs. Erlynne.

The opening of the play establishes Lady Windermere in her morning-room, where she is preparing for a party in celebration of her birthday. As she interacts with Lord Darlington, their dialogue reveals her strong moral convictions and concerns about men's behavior. Soon after, the Duchess of Berwick enters and shares alarming gossip about Lady Windermereâ€™s husband, indicating he is close to Mrs. Erlynne. Lady Windermere's growing anxiety regarding her husband's loyalty becomes palpable.
