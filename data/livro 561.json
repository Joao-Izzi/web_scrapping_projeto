    "resumo": "\"Glow Worm\" by Harlan Ellison is a science fiction short story written during the mid-20th century. The narrative revolves around the themes of isolation and the consequences of humanity's actions, exploring the aftermath of a catastrophic war that has decimated life on Earth. The protagonist, Seligman, is a remarkable human specimen, transformed by experiments into a glowing, invulnerable being, symbolizing the last remnant of humanity in a world now devoid of life.  In the story, Seligman grapples with his profound loneliness as the sole survivor after humanity has annihilated itself through war. With his peculiar green glow and newfound powers rendering him impervious to harm, he embarks on a journey to find any traces of life among the stars, ultimately learning that his transformation has left him further estranged from his humanity. As he readsies himself for departure, he reflects on the fate of his species and his own existence, realizing he is now more a symbol of humanity's destruction rather than a participant in its continuation. The tale culminates in Seligman renouncing his hope for connection, resigning to an eternal solitude that embodies the grim truth of mankind's legacy. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
