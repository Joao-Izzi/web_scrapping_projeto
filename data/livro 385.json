    "resumo": "\"Merimiehen matkamuistelmia 2\" by Aukusti Högman is a travel memoir written in the late 19th century. The book recounts the author's experiences at sea and in various ports, including his reflections on life, death, and the human condition as he navigates the challenges of a sailor's life. Högman's narrative reveals not only the adventures at sea but also poignant moments of loss, particularly concerning his late wife, Mary.  At the start of the narrative, the author shares his previous experiences, including a shipwreck and his time in a hospital, which led him to lose his desire for life at sea. However, upon the suggestion of a doctor, he decides to join a new voyage to Calcutta, aiming to eventually visit Glasgow to learn about his late wife's fate. He embarks on this journey as a crew member on the ship \"Breacin Castle,\" where he gradually regains his strength and encounters a tragic incident involving the ship's first mate, Mr. Dalton, who succumbs to his overwhelming grief. This event triggers reflections on life and personal fortune amidst the harsh realities of seafaring life, setting the tone for Högman's subsequent adventures and observations in foreign lands.
