    "resumo": "\"The Silver Poppy\" by Arthur Stringer is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story centers around John Hartley, a young man from Oxford who has recently relocated to New York City to immerse himself in American life and literature. As he navigates the vibrant and chaotic world around him, he encounters a variety of characters, including the successful author Cordelia Vaughan, who represents the complexities of ambition, creativity, and societal expectations in the bustling backdrop of a burgeoning literary scene.  At the start of the novel, Hartley finds himself at a birthday celebration for the artist Repellier. The atmosphere is lively, filled with artists and performers reveling in creative exuberance, yet Hartley feels out of place among them. While engaging with the guests, he expresses his aspirations and frustrations about the harsh realities of life as a struggling writer in America. His initial encounter with Cordelia Vaughan reveals a more personal aspect of his characterâ€”his desire for connection amidst the overwhelming whirlwind of New York City. This opening sets the stage for an exploration of artistry, personal struggle, and the interplay between success and authenticity, as Hartley grapples with his identity and ambitions in a world that promises both inspiration and challenges.
