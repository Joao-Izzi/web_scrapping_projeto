    "resumo": "\"Irish Memories\" by E. Œ. Somerville and Martin Ross is a collection of autobiographical narratives written in the early 20th century. This reflective work delves into the authors' experiences and observations throughout their lives in Ireland, touching upon personal anecdotes, the charm of Irish society, and the landscapes of their homeland. The intertwining friendship between Somerville and Ross, as well as their shared insights on Irish life, forms the heart of the narrative.  At the start of the memoir, Somerville expresses her gratitude towards various individuals who contributed to her journey and acknowledges the challenges she faces in recounting her friend Martin Ross’s memories after her passing. Somerville plans to share these vignettes, addressing Martin with a heartfelt familiarity and emphasizing their close bond. She acknowledges that the book will not adhere strictly to biographical norms but rather serves as a whimsical reflection of past events, personalities, and the changes within Irish culture, particularly as they relate to the close-knit relationships and social dynamics of their upbringing at Ross House.
