    "resumo": "\"Children of the Arctic\" by Josephine Diebitsch Peary and Marie Ahnighito Peary is a children's narrative published in the early 20th century. This delightful account revolves around the experiences of a young girl, AH-NI-GHI´-TO, who is the daughter of Arctic explorer Robert Peary. The book focuses on themes of adventure, exploration, and cultural exchange through AH-NI-GHI´-TO's journey to the Arctic, blending elements of a personal narrative with reflections on the Inuit way of life.  The story follows AH-NI-GHI´-TO as she embarks on a transformative voyage to reunite with her father in the Arctic after a prolonged separation. Through her eyes, readers are introduced to the fascinating world of the Inuit, their customs, and the harsh yet beautiful landscapes of the North. As she prepares for and makes the journey across treacherous icy waters aboard the \"Windward,\" we witness her excitement, fears, and the friendships she cultivates with both Inuit children and shipmates. The narrative also explores her emotional growth as she confronts loss, learns about her father's work, and adapts to living in a world defined by extreme weather and close-knit communities, ultimately offering young readers a vivid glimpse into the Arctic and the life lessons that come with exploration and resilience.
