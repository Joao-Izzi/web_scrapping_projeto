    "resumo": "\"Michael\" by E. F. Benson is a novel written during the early 20th century, likely capturing the complexities of class and personal ambition in Britain. The story revolves around Michael Comber, the son of a British lord, who struggles with the expectations placed upon him and expresses a deep desire to pursue music instead of following the family tradition of military service—a choice that is met with resistance from his father.  The opening of the book introduces Michael in his flat in London, where he has just provided financial assistance to his cousin Francis. Their conversation reveals Michael’s awkwardness in navigating social situations and contrasts with Francis's more carefree disposition. Michael's struggle is further depicted through his resignation from the army, motivated by a passion for music that he wishes to cultivate. His dissatisfaction with the superficial expectations of nobility is emphasized as he reflects on his family’s tradition while secretly yearning for the artistic life that lies beyond the confines of his aristocratic upbringing. As he prepares to face his father’s inevitable disapproval, the stage is set for a deeper exploration of individuality versus social obligation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
