    "resumo": "\"A Complete Grammar of Esperanto\" by Ivy Kellerman Reed is an instructional textbook written in the early 20th century. The book serves as a thorough guide to the international language Esperanto, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of its grammar, structure, and usage, complete with graded exercises for reading and translation.   The opening of the text begins with a transcriber's note about the unique aspects of the Esperanto alphabet, detailing the characters used and the diacritical marks that distinguish them. Reed explains the foundational elements of the language, such as its phonetics, the use of diacritical letters, and various transliteration methods adopted to accommodate different formats or systems, like ASCII. This initial section sets the stage for the subsequent lessons that delve into more complex grammatical concepts, grounding readers in the structure required to master Esperanto.
