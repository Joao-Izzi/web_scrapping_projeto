    "resumo": "\"Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden historia\" by Eino Leino is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The work explores the development of Finnish literature from the early writings in the Finnish language to the emergence of significant literary movements and figures. Through its detailed examination, it sheds light on the evolution of Finnish identity and culture as expressed through literature, highlighting key contributors like Mikael Agricola and Elias LÃ¶nnrot.  The opening of the text sets the stage for understanding the historical context of Finnish literature, beginning with its linguistic roots during the period of 1542 to 1835. It emphasizes the importance of language as a vehicle of expression and identity for the Finnish people. Leino discusses the contributions of early figures such as Mikael Agricola, who played a critical role in establishing written Finnish and the development of religious literature. Additionally, he addresses the challenges faced in the cultivation of this rich literary tradition against the backdrop of foreign influence and cultural shifts, laying the foundation for the subsequent discussions on the rise of a national literary consciousness in Finland.
