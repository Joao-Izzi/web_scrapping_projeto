    "resumo": "\"The Tragedy of Titus Andronicus\" by William Shakespeare is a tragic play written in the late 16th century. The play revolves around themes of revenge, power struggles, and the consequences of violence, focusing particularly on the character of Titus Andronicus, a Roman general who returns home after war with the Goths, only to find himself embroiled in political machinations and personal tragedy.  At the start of the play, a political conflict emerges as Saturninus and Bassianus vie for the Roman Empire following the death of the previous emperor. Titus Andronicus is celebrated for his military victories but faces the grief of losing many sons in battle. The opening sets a stage of tumult where Titus arrives to seek proper burial for his sons while contending with the ambitions of the ambitious contenders for the throne. As the dynamics of betrayal and revenge begin to unfold, tensions rise, foreshadowing the tragic events that will ensue throughout the play. The tone is dark and foreboding, highlighting themes of loyalty, honor, and the harsh realities of power in Rome. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
