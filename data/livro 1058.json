    "resumo": "\"Heart\" by Henry Slesar is a science fiction short story published in the mid-20th century. The narrative centers around Fletcher Monk, an industrialist with a failing heart, who believes he can manipulate circumstances and wealth to secure his health. The story explores themes of mortality, the limits of money, and human resilience in the face of physical decline, set against a backdrop of futuristic medical possibilities and space colonization.  In the story, Fletcher Monk visits Dr. Rostov, who informs him of the dire state of his heart condition, which has been neglected for years. Monk refuses to accept that his health cannot be improved through financial means and sets out on a quest to escape to Mars, where he believes the lower gravity will save him. Throughout the tale, Monk’s dogged pursuit of medical solutions, akin to buying his way out of trouble, ultimately leads him to a stark realization about life in the Mars Colony, where hard work and collaboration are essential for survival. Despite a brief period of improvement, Monk’s insistence on maintaining his old identity and ways ultimately results in his demise, hinting at a deeper emotional struggle as he is metaphorically \"dying of a broken heart.\" (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
