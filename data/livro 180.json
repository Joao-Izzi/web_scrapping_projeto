    "resumo": "\"The Autobiography of a Play\" by Bronson Howard is a reflective analysis on theatrical writing, structured as a lecture delivered before the Shakspere Society at Harvard University in the late 19th century. This work delves into the complexities of playwriting, revealing insights into the dramatic construction that Howard navigated while adapting one of his own plays, \"The Banker's Daughter,\" across different audiences and cultural contexts. The book offers a unique exploration into the themes of love, sacrifice, and the inherent laws of drama that govern narrative structures, providing a broader view of American theater during an era of significant artistic development.  In this autobiographical account, Howard recounts the evolution of his play through various adaptations, emphasizing the changes made to meet the expectations of different audiences in Chicago, New York, and London. He discusses character development, the importance of moral lessons within narratives, and the necessity of altering plots to ensure audience satisfaction. For example, he illustrates how the protagonist's survival in the final act transformed the play’s moral implications, ultimately deepening the emotional stakes.
