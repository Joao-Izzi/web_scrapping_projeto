    "resumo": "\"A Black Adonis\" by Albert Ross is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story centers on Shirley Roseleaf, a young aspiring author grappling with rejection from a prestigious publishing house, Cutt & Slashem, which he believes has overlooked his talent. The book explores themes of ambition, love, and the search for artistic validity against societal expectations.  The opening of the novel introduces Shirley as he anxiously awaits a response from the publishers regarding his manuscript. When he receives a letter of rejection, he is devastated, yet it stirs a powerful sense of indignation and determination within him. The narrative quickly transitions from his despair to his confrontational visit to the publishing firm, revealing not only his emotional turmoil but also the contrasting views on his literary aspirations between him and the more pragmatic, business-minded characters he encounters. Alongside this journey, the introduction of Millicent Fern, another aspiring writer whose bold manuscript is also rejected, sets the stage for intertwining plots centered around love, literature, and self-discovery.
