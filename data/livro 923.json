    "resumo": "\"The Count of Nideck\" by Ralph Browning Fiske and Erckmann-Chatrian is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set in the year 1780 and revolves around Gaston, who is summoned to the Castle of Nideck by his foster-father Gideon Sperver. The primary focus is on the mysterious illness of the Count of Nideck, which seems to be linked to both the family's legacy and the refusal of his daughter, Countess Odile, to marry despite her father's desperately seeking a cure through her union.  The opening of the book introduces the reader to Gaston, who is approached by Gideon to return with him to the Count's estate due to the Count's unsettling health condition. On their journey through the snow-laden landscape, Gideon shares troubling details about the Count's malady, which includes episodes of madness triggered by the presence of a mysterious old woman known as the \"Black Plague.\" Upon reaching the castle, Gaston prepares to confront the intricacies of noble life intertwined with family duty, while also meeting Countess Odile, who exhibits extraordinary composure amid her father's turmoil. As tensions rise between father and daughter regarding her potential marriage, the narrative sets the stage for themes of generational conflict, the weight of expectations, and the specter of familial duty.
