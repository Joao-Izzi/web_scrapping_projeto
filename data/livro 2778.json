    "resumo": "\"Geographic Range of the Hooded Skunk, Mephitis macroura\" by Hall and Dalquest is a scientific publication written in the mid-20th century. This work provides a detailed examination of the geographical distribution and taxonomy of the hooded skunk, specifically identifying and describing a new subspecies found in Mexico. The text is informative and geared towards readers interested in mammalogy and ecological studies.  In this publication, the authors explore the characteristics and range of the hooded skunk, detailing the differentiating features among various subspecies. They describe four subspecies of Mephitis macroura, including the newly identified Mephitis macroura eximius. The paper discusses the specific habitats in which these skunks are found, their physical features, and how environmental factors such as elevation and vegetation influence their distribution across regions like the Mexican Plateau and coastal Veracruz. Through this research, Hall and Dalquest provide valuable insights into the life of the hooded skunk and its adaptation to different ecological niches. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
