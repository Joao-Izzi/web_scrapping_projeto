    "resumo": "\"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12)\" by G. Maspero is a historical account written in the late 19th century. This volume delves into the complex interactions, conquests, and cultural exchanges between the Iranian empires and the ancient civilizations of the Near East, focusing on the Median Empire and its transition to Persian dominance under figures such as Cyrus and Cambyses. It likely covers the political and religious dynamics during the rise of Zoroastrianism and its profound impact on Iranian and surrounding cultures.  The opening of this historical work introduces the concept of the Iranian conquest, discussing the relatively obscure nature of the Median Empire compared to its predecessors, such as the Chaldæan empire. The text highlights the limited primary sources available on the Medes, relying on later accounts to piece together their history, the origins of Zoroastrianism, and the life of its prophet, Zoroaster. It notes the social and religious structures of the ancient Iranian world and hints at the battles and political maneuvers surrounding the rise of Cyrus, setting the stage for a detailed historical exploration of these ancient civilizations and their interactions with neighboring cultures.
