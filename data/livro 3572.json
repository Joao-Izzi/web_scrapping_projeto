    "resumo": "\"Around the Camp-fire\" by Charles G. D. Roberts is a collection of outdoor adventure stories written in the late 19th century. The book focuses on a group of canoeists embarking on a journey into the wilderness of New Brunswick, where they encounter various wildlife and engage in story-telling around the campfire. The camaraderie of the main characters—Stranion, Magnus, Queerman, Sam, Ranolf, and the narrator—underscores the themes of friendship and adventure.  The opening of the book introduces the six canoeists as they escape the summer heat of Fredericton in search of the wilderness. They prepare for their journey to the Squatooks with details of their canoeing gear and the route they plan to take. On their first night camping near the Madawaska River, the group shares stories, with Stranion recounting a particularly harrowing childhood encounter with a panther at the parsonage, showcasing the blend of humor, suspense, and the natural beauty that will permeate their adventures. As they settle in for the night, each character contributes to the storytelling tradition by sharing tales of their past experiences in the wild, setting the tone for the narratives that will follow in the subsequent chapters.
