    "resumo": "\"The Admirable Bashville; or, Constancy Unrewarded\" by Bernard Shaw is a stage play written in the early 20th century. This work adapts Shaw's earlier novel \"Cashel Byron's Profession\" into a dramatic format, exploring themes of class, ambition, and the nature of manhood, particularly through its central character, Cashel Byron, a prizefighter. The play examines the conflict between material success and moral integrity, alongside a critique of social class hierarchies.  The opening of \"The Admirable Bashville\" introduces us to Lydia Carew, the wealthy heiress of Wiltstoken Park, who laments her loneliness despite her riches and social standing. In a chance encounter, she meets Cashel Byron, initially mistaking him for a sylvan god. Their conversation reveals their contrasting worldsâ€”Lydia's cultured life versus Cashel's rough existence as a fighter. As their relationship develops, the tension between their social standings becomes evident, particularly when Cashel is confronted by his trainer, Bob Mellish, about the responsibilities of his boxing career. This intertwining of their lives sets the stage for themes of love, ambition, and the struggles that define their characters throughout the play. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
