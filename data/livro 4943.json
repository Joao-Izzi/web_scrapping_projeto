    "resumo": "\"On the Age of Maya Ruins\" by Charles P. Bowditch is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. The book discusses the historical dating of Mayan ruins, focusing on an inscription discovered in Chichen Itza and how it relates to the chronology of other ancient Mayan cities. Bowditch aims to establish the relative ages of these ruins using various glyphs and dates found in the region.  In this work, Bowditch presents a detailed analysis of the Initial Series of glyphs from the Chichen Itza inscription, comparing it with known dates from other ruined cities such as Piedras Negras, Copan, Quirigua, and Palenque. He meticulously calculates and discusses the implications of these dates, speculating about the contemporaneity of various Mayan cities and their historical contexts. His findings suggest that these cities flourished simultaneously for certain periods, offering insights into the migratory patterns and history of the Mayan civilization, while emphasizing the importance of further investigation into the region's archaeological record.
