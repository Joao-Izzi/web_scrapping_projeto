    "resumo": "\"Philosophical Transactions, Vol. L. Part II. For the year 1758\" by Various et al. is a scientific publication written in the mid-18th century. This volume is a collection of various papers, letters, and observations presented to the Royal Society, covering a range of topics including electricity, astronomy, natural phenomena, and medical case studies. It serves as a historical document that showcases the scientific inquiries and discoveries of the time, providing insight into early modern science and its practitioners.  At the start of the volume, the text provides a transcriber’s note, explaining the nature of the publication and the adjustments made to the original content for clarity. Following this, it presents an account by Benjamin Franklin regarding the effects of electricity on paralysis, detailing his observations on patients treated with electrical shocks. Franklin describes the immediate sensations felt by the patients and their temporary improvements in movement, despite noting a lack of lasting benefits. Another letter discusses a recent comet sighting, while subsequent sections list diverse scientific observations, such as temperature variations, earthquake reports, and plant behavior, illustrating the breadth of inquiry characteristic of the Royal Society’s investigations during this period.
