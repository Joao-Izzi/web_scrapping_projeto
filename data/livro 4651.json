    "resumo": "\"Shaggycoat: The Biography of a Beaver\" by Clarence Hawkes is a nature-focused narrative likely written in the early 20th century. The story follows the life of Shaggycoat, a young beaver, as he navigates a world filled with danger, loss, and growth while exploring themes of survival and resilience in the face of threats from both nature and humanity.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Shaggycoat, a two-year-old beaver who flees with his grandfather from their home in Beaver City, which has been tragically invaded by humans hunting for pelts. The opening chapters vividly detail the beaversâ€™ previous life of tranquility, their tight-knit family relationships, and the sheer terror of their sudden displacement. As they escape into the night, Shaggycoat is forced to confront new dangers, including the eventual loss of his grandfather and the chilling realization of his solitary status in a vast wilderness, setting the stage for his journey of survival and self-discovery.
