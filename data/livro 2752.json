    "resumo": "\"Baudelaire: His Prose and Poetry\" edited by T. R. Smith is a collection of works by the influential French poet Charles Baudelaire, compiled in the early 20th century. This anthology includes Baudelaire's renowned prose poems, as well as selections from his groundbreaking verses such as \"The Flowers of Evil.\" The collection delves into themes of beauty, decadence, and the complexities of human experience, presenting Baudelaire as a central figure in modern literature whose style laid the groundwork for Symbolism and later poetic movements.  The opening of the anthology sets a contemplative tone, beginning with a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne dedicated to Baudelaire's memory. It reflects on themes of loss, beauty, the passage of time, and the artist's struggle with existential despair. Following this tribute, the editor provides a preface that outlines Baudelaire's significance, emphasizing his philosophical insights into art and emotion that challenge conventional morality and beauty. Additionally, the opening portion introduces various prose poems that capture the depth of Baudelaire's perception, exploring the intricacies of love, longing, and the interplay between reality and illusion.
