    "resumo": "\"April Hopes\" by William Dean Howells is a novel written in the late 19th century, during a time when American society was grappling with changes brought on by modernity and shifting social norms. The story centers around Elbridge G. Mavering, a man observing the festive Class Day at Harvard University, where he reflects on the past and meets various characters that embody the complexities of gender dynamics, youth, and social expectations. Through the interactions of Mavering with notable individuals, such as Mrs. Pasmer and her daughter Alice, the narrative explores themes of social acceptance, romance, and the differences in societal roles between men and women.  At the start of the novel, the lively atmosphere of the Class Day is vividly set in the Hemenway Gymnasium, filled with young couples enjoying the celebrations. Mavering, having been introduced to Mrs. Pasmer, finds himself in discussions about the changing roles of women and men's expectations in society. Their dialogue reflects the evolving views on chivalry and attention that young women supposedly receive from men in contemporary society. As Mavering grapples with these ideas, he observes a younger generation of students and their accompanying social practices, hinting at the generational transitions in values and behaviors. The opening establishes a rich social tapestry, setting the stage for deeper explorations of character relationships and the implications of society's rapid transformations.
