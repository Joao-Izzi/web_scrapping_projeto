    "resumo": "\"Letters on England\" by Voltaire is a collection of reflective essays written during the early 18th century, specifically in the context of Voltaire's experience during his time in England. The work serves as an exploration of English society, politics, and religion, examining the customs and philosophy of the English people through Voltaire’s keenly ironic and critical lens.  At the start of the text, Voltaire introduces himself and his conversations with a Quaker, showcasing the stark contrasts between English religious practices and those of the Quakers. He describes a visit to a Quaker elder, presenting their unusual beliefs about baptism and communion, which challenge conventional Christian practices. Through a dialogue full of wit and curiosity, Voltaire captures the Quaker's perspectives on spirituality, social customs, and their views on human conduct—reflecting on themes of piety, simplicity, and the complexities of religious beliefs. The opening sets the tone for a broader discussion on various religious and sectarian practices within England, promising a rich tapestry of cultural critique that follows in the subsequent letters.
