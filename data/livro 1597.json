    "resumo": "\"Stalemate in Space\" by Charles L. Harness is a science fiction novel written during the mid-20th century, likely in the 1940s. The narrative revolves around a fierce battle in space involving two massive battle globes: the Terran \"Defender\" and the Scythian \"Invader\". As the tension unfolds, the story delves into themes of duty, survival, and sacrifice as a woman named Evelyn Kane faces the harrowing aftermath of war and confronts her own destiny amidst intergalactic conflict.  The plot follows Evelyn, who is awakened after years of dormancy in a sealed chamber on the \"Defender\" to find her people on the brink of defeat at the hands of their enemies, the Scythians. With limited time and a dire situation, she recalls her father's last moments and her commitment to either save their planet or die trying. The narrative explores her desperate struggle to activate a device that could destroy both battle globes, while also weaving in her encounters with Scythian soldiers and her complex interplay with their commander, Perat. As she navigates this treacherous terrain, the story evolves into a poignant exploration of love and sacrifice, leading to a climax that intertwines themes of time, identity, and the hope for a future free of war.
