Set against the vivid backdrop of Viking-era Iceland, the narrative follows the protagonist, Rolf, the son of a farmer named Hiarandi, who grapples with the misfortunes that have befallen his family, tied to an ancestral curse.

At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to Hiarandi, known as the Unlucky, who struggles with the burdens of a cursed lineage. After Hiarandi's wife, Asdis, urges him to light a beacon to save shipwrecked sailors, the decision leads to unexpected troubles.
