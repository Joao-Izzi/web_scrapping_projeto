    "resumo": "\"Rilla of the Lighthouse\" by Grace May North is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story unfolds on Windy Island, where the main character, Rilla, a spirited and adventurous girl, lives with her grandfather, Captain Ezra Bassett, who is the keeper of the lighthouse. The narrative weaves together themes of discovery, family connections, and the innocence of youth, as Rilla embarks on her first real adventures, including a mysterious box found on the beach and her encounters with a city boy named Gene Beavers.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Rilla and her loyal dog, Shags, as they explore the beach near their lighthouse. Rilla discovers a strange, banded box in the surf, prompting curiosity and excitement about its contents. As she returns home, her relationship with her grandfather reveals a tender dynamicâ€”her grandfather expresses worry about Rilla's future, reflecting on family ties and the challenges of letting go. The opening sets the stage for Rilla's upcoming adventures, not only with the box's secrets but also with the arrival of Gene, hinting at themes of friendship, identity, and the push and pull between youthful freedom and familial obligations.
