    "resumo": "\"Candide\" by Voltaire is a satirical novel written in the mid-18th century. This work follows the misadventures of its main character, Candide, who is born into a privileged life but is soon expelled from his idyllic home and thrust into a world filled with absurdity, violence, and philosophical challenges. The story critiques the optimistic philosophy of the time, particularly through Candide's interactions with various characters and the dire circumstances he encounters.  The opening of \"Candide\" sets the stage with a glimpse into the life of the titular character, who grows up in the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh, where he is taught by the optimistic philosopher Pangloss. Candide experiences a moment of youthful passion with Cunegonde, the Baron's daughter, but when discovered, he is brutally expelled from the castle. His naive belief that he lives in \"the best of all possible worlds\" is quickly challenged as he is thrust into a harsh reality marked by war and suffering. The beginning establishes the central themes of philosophy, love, and the inherent absurdity of life that will continue to develop throughout the novel.
