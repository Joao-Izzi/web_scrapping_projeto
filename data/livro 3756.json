    "resumo": "\"Ralph Raymond's Heir\" by Horatio Alger Jr. is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows the character Ralph Raymond, who, in his final days, reveals to his friend Paul Morton that he has a son named Robert Raymond, setting off a chain of intriguing events that blend themes of deception and the quest for wealth. Morton's ambitions, coupled with the backdrop of Ralph's terminal illness, raise the stakes as loyalties are tested, and the reader is introduced to the struggles of several characters navigating the complexities of morality and greed.  At the start of the story, we meet James Cromwell, a clerk in a drugstore who sells a rare poison to a mysterious customer, which leads to suspicions regarding the customer's intentions. We are introduced to the affluent yet troubled Paul Morton, who grapples with financial stresses and the impending loss of his wealthier friend, Ralph Raymond, who comes to stay with him as he nears death. The opening chapters establish a tense atmosphere marked by impending doom and moral corruption, as Cromwell’s discovery of Morton’s connection to the poison and the fate of Ralph’s son sets the stage for a thrilling narrative filled with betrayal and the possible misfortune that accompanies the pursuit of riches.
