    "resumo": "\"Genera of Leptodactylid Frogs in México\" by John D. Lynch is a scientific publication written in the late 20th century. This work delves into the taxonomy and classification of leptodactylid frogs found in Mexico, providing detailed insights into the various genera of these amphibians. The book is likely pivotal for herpetologists and researchers interested in amphibian biodiversity and taxonomy in Latin America.  In this publication, Lynch reviews the known genera of leptodactylid frogs in Mexico, updating previous classifications based on extensive research conducted since the mid-20th century. He identifies six genera, including \"Eleutherodactylus\", \"Syrrhophus\", and \"Tomodactylus\", among others, and discusses critical morphological features that differentiate them. The author also introduces a new genus, \"Hylactophryne\", and provides an analysis of anatomical characteristics such as gland structure and skeletal features to support the revised classification. Through this detailed examination, Lynch aims to contribute to a clearer understanding of the phylogenetic relationships and geographical distribution of these diverse frog species.
