Through a critical lens, Darroch analyzes the current unrest in education, calling for a more coherent and purposeful approach to educating the youth.  The opening of the text establishes a pressing discontentment with the existing educational framework, portraying it as fragmented and insufficient in fostering capable future citizens. Darroch highlights the lack of coordination among various educational levels and critiques the shortsightedness of policies that do not cater to the comprehensive development of a child.
