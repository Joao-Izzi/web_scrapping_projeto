    "resumo": "\"Talks with Tolstoi\" by Aleksandr Borisovich Golʹdenveĭzer is a collection of diary entries written in the early 20th century. This work chronicles the intimate conversations and reflections of the author regarding his friendship with the renowned Russian author Leo Tolstoi. The diary captures not only Tolstoi's thoughts on art, philosophy, and morality but also highlights the personal connection and experiences shared between the two men, providing an insightful glimpse into the life and beliefs of one of literature's greatest figures.  The opening of this diary introduces us first to the author as a young musician visiting Tolstoi's home, where he experiences a mix of excitement and shyness. Through the author's eyes, we see Tolstoi's approachable nature and his profound insights into music and art, reflecting on concepts such as emptiness versus virtuosity in art. As the entries progress, we witness a developing friendship that offers a window into Tolstoi’s philosophical musings on life, religion, and the nature of art, juxtaposed against essential anecdotes that capture their interactions. This intimate portrayal allows readers to not only understand Tolstoi as an iconic writer but also as a thoughtful, engaging individual who deeply considered the essence of existence and the role of the artist.
