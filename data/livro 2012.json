    "resumo": "\"The O'Ruddy: A Romance\" by Stephen Crane and Robert Barr is a novel written in the early 20th century. The book follows Tom O'Ruddy, a young man from Ireland who embarks on a journey to deliver important papers to the Earl of Westport, his father’s old comrade. Along the way, O'Ruddy encounters friendship, duels, and unexpected adventures, revealing the contrasts between his Irish background and the English society he enters.  At the start of the story, O'Ruddy recounts the legacy of his family, which was once prominent in Ireland but has fallen into obscurity. After the death of his father, O'Ruddy sets off to fulfill his late father's last request to return some papers to the Earl. His humorous encounters begin in Bristol, where he makes a splash at a local inn, challenging a Colonel’s dishonorable remarks about his father and inadvertently setting the stage for a duel. These initial misadventures highlight O'Ruddy's fiery spirit and charm as he navigates the unfamiliar terrain of English gentry, foreshadowing the tumultuous events that will follow.
