    "resumo": "\"The Adventures of François\" by S. Weir Mitchell is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The book follows the life of François, a foundling who navigates the tumultuous landscape of Paris during the French Revolution, encountering various roles such as a choir boy, thief, juggler, and fencing master. The story explores his misadventures and relationships as he grapples with the challenges of his upbringing and the societal changes around him.  At the start of the novel, we meet François, a cheerful and observant child raised in the Benedictine Asylum for Orphans. As he matures into a choir boy at Notre Dame, he experiences the rigid and demanding structure of life in the choir house, which ultimately leads to a loss of his prized singing voice. Following a series of unfortunate events, including his rejection from the choir and a tumultuous encounter with a cruel steward, François decides to leave the confines of the asylum. His journey from innocence to the harsh realities of street life introduces him to the pleasures and pitfalls of freedom, as he learns to rely on his wit and charm amidst the chaos of revolutionary Paris.
