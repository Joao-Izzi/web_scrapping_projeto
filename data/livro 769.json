    "resumo": "\"The Poets and Poetry of Cecil County, Maryland\" by George Johnston is a historical collection of poetry compiled in the late 19th century. This work aims to honor the memory of David Scott, who significantly contributed to the local literary scene as a poet and educator, by not only including his works but also presenting poems from other native poets of Cecil County and those who have lived there.   The opening portion of the book establishes its foundation by explaining the initial purpose behind its creation, stemming from a desire to commemorate David Scott. Johnston discusses how, despite limitations in gathering a comprehensive selection of poetry from all the local poets, he has curated a collection that showcases the talents of these writers, particularly emphasizing Scott's works. The preface introduces the poet and the editor, presenting both the respect held for Scott and the collaborative effort made by the community to honor a cherished figure in Cecil County's literary history.
