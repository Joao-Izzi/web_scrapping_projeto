    "resumo": "\"MICHAËL CHORÆI SAMLADE SKALDESTYCKEN\" by Michaël Choraeus is a collection of poetry written in the early 19th century. The work compiles a variety of poetic forms including elegies, prize writings, and mixed verses, reflecting on themes such as love, virtue, and the human condition. Choraeus, as a poet and religious figure, seems to impart a deep emotional and moral perspective through his compositions.  The opening of this collection begins with a preface by F. M. Franzén, who explains the long-awaited publication of Choraeus’ works following his untimely death. In a nostalgic tone, the author discusses the poet's life — noting his struggles and triumphs — and explains the challenges faced in compiling the scattered verses. The initial poems include personal reflections and tributes, setting a heartfelt tone that invites the reader into the emotional world of Choraeus' poetry, characterized by both its lyrical beauty and philosophical depth.
