    "resumo": "“The Mysterious Rider” by Zane Grey is a novel written in the early 20th century. The narrative centers on the complexities of love and identity within the backdrop of the Colorado wilderness. The main character, a girl named Columbine, grapples with her mysterious origins and the impending return of Jack Belllounds, the son of her guardian, Bill Belllounds, who plans for them to marry, despite her uncertainty about Jack and an unrecognized connection to Wilson Moore, a cowboy and her childhood friend.  At the start of the novel, Columbine returns to a scenic bluff overlooking her ranch, reflecting on the mystery surrounding her origins and her life in the care of Bill Bellounds. As she reminisces, Jack Belllounds is announced to be returning home after years away, and Bill reveals to Columbine that she is not his biological child but was found as a baby in the wilderness. Faced with this revelation, Columbine is torn between her loyalty to Bill and her feelings toward Jack, whom she does not love. In the midst of this emotional turmoil, Wilson Moore, a cowboy who has harbored feelings for Columbine, appears, complicating her situation further as tension builds between him and Jack. This opening sets up a rich tapestry of relationships, secrets, and the struggles of choosing one's destiny. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
