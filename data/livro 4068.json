    "resumo": "\"A Diplomat's Memoir of 1870\" by Frederic Reitlinger is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The narrative recounts significant events surrounding the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War and depicts the author's perilous experiences as he undertakes politically motivated balloon escapes and diplomatic endeavors. The memoir also discusses political tensions in Europe during this tumultuous time and shed light on the French national spirit in the face of adversity.  The opening of this memoir introduces us to Reitlingerâ€™s role as a private secretary to M. Jules Favre, the Vice-President of the Provisional Government. Amidst the backdrop of a besieged Paris, Reitlinger receives a mission to journey to London and Vienna, hoping to garner support for France while rallying European leaders in favor of a peace process. The text captures the atmosphere of hope and unity among the citizens and government officials in Paris, all while foreshadowing the eventual realization of their aspirations will be met with disappointment as Prussia's might prevails.
