    "resumo": "\"Romeo en Julia\" by William Shakespeare is a classic tragedy written in the late 16th century. The play tells the heart-wrenching story of two young lovers, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, whose love is doomed by their families' longstanding feud. Themes of love, fate, and the consequences of hate are explored throughout this timeless work.  The opening of \"Romeo en Julia\" sets the stage in Verona, introducing several characters and the backdrop of a bitter conflict between the Montague and Capulet families. A prologue delivered by a chorus foreshadows the tragic fate of the titular characters, born from this enmity. The first act depicts a street brawl instigated by the servants of both houses and reveals the somber mood surrounding Romeo, who is infatuated with another woman, Rosalind. His friend Benvolio urges him to forget this unrequited love, yet the arrival of the Capulet family's annual feast provides an opportunity for Romeo to encounter Julietâ€”a moment destined to change their lives forever.
