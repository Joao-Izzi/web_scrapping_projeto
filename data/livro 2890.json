    "resumo": "\"Land Beyond the Flame\" by Evelyn Goldstein is a science fiction novel likely penned in the mid-20th century. The narrative centers around a desolate world divided by a perilous Flame Barrier, which holds secrets about the origins of humanity and the promise of salvation through unity between two distinct peoples: the Numan, an advanced but emotionally stunted group, and the Olman, who are seen as primitive but embody passion and vitality. The story explores themes of love, rebellion against oppressive systems, and the need for cooperation across cultural divides.  The plot follows Allyn, a disillusioned Numan outcast who rescues Keeven, an Olman, from a pack of predatory creatures. Allyn has rebelled against his people to save his sister Aleena from a lethal mating ritual decreed by the Logicians. In a bid to save their respective kin from extinction—Numan women die during childbirth—Allyn, Keeven, and Keeven’s sister Marva embark on a journey to transcend the Flame Barrier in search of knowledge that may unlock a solution. Throughout their adventures, they confront not only external threats but also their internal preconceptions about each other. Ultimately, Allyn's journey challenges the foundations of their societies and paves the way for a new era of understanding and collaboration. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
