    "resumo": "\"Lost Ships and Lonely Seas\" by Ralph Delahaye Paine is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book recounts the tales of maritime disasters, focusing on various shipwrecks and the heroic or tragic circumstances surrounding them. It captures not just the physical challenges faced by sailors but also the emotional, moral, and survival dilemmas encountered during these harrowing experiences.  At the start of the book, the narrative introduces the brig \"Polly\", which embarked on a perilous voyage from Boston to Santa Cruz in December 1811. The passengers included Captain Cazneau, a mate, and four sailors, with two passengersâ€”a man and a young girl. Shortly after departing, a violent storm dismasts the \"Polly\", leaving her crew battling for survival amid harsh conditions at sea. Over the following months, they endure hunger and deprivation, employing desperate measures to stay alive. Their story unfolds in gripping detail, highlighting the grit and fortitude of sailors adrift on lonely seas, and sets the tone for the subsequent tales of adventure, loss, and survival in maritime history.
