The story centers around Leonore, a young widow grappling with the aftermath of her husband Godfrey Stubbs' unexpected death.

The opening of the book introduces the reader to the tumultuous emotions surrounding Leonore’s return home and the fallout from her husband’s financial ruin. Her father, General Boldero, vehemently expresses his disdain for the circumstances that have left her without financial security, revealing his opportunistic views regarding social status and wealth. Among the family dynamics, Leonore struggles with feelings of isolation and apprehension about her future while confronting the harsh realities of her newfound situation as both a widow and a financial dependent.
