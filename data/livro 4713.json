    "resumo": "\"Mollie's Prince: A Novel\" by Rosa Nouchette Carey is a fictional work written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds within a family dynamic where the two main characters, Waveney and Mollie Ward, navigate the challenges of their modest lives while supporting their artist father, Everard Ward. It highlights their relationships with each other and with the supporting characters, such as the old pensioners and their whimsical young brother, Noel.  The beginning of the novel introduces Cleveland Terrace, Chelsea, with an atmospheric depiction of the old surroundings that reflect the characters' struggles against the backdrop of nostalgia. As the sisters engage in the daily routine of caring for their father and the household, the narrative illustrates Mollie's physical infirmity and Waveney's thoughtful considerations about her family's financial difficulties. Their interactions with Corporal Marks and Sergeant McGill also set a tone of warmth and humor. Waveney's pressing desire to seek work in order to support the family emerges, along with her sense of duty and responsibility towards her sisters, leading to a poignant portrayal of their aspirations amidst trials of poverty and artistic ambition.
