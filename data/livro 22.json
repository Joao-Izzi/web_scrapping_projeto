The opening of \"Thackerayana\" sets the stage by recounting Thackeray's school experiences, highlighting his creativity and wit from a young age. It details his time at the Charterhouse School, where he delighted in drawing caricatures of teachers and illustrating stories from his favorite childhood books. Anecdotes about his early interactions with literature, such as sketching in the margins of texts and crafting humorous poetry, reveal the budding talent that would later flourish into his acclaimed literary career. The introduction hints at the blend of nostalgia and sharp humor that permeates the entire collection, inviting readers to appreciate the masterful way Thackeray intertwines personal narratives with broader reflections on literature and society.
