    "resumo": "\"Latin America: Its Rise and Progress\" by Francisco García Calderón is a historical account written in the early 20th century. This work explores the evolution, struggles for independence, and socio-political development of Latin American countries, focusing particularly on the influences from Spain and Portugal and the subsequent conflicts that shaped the countries of South America. The detailed examination of various nations presents a narrative of resilience amid oppression and the quest for identity.  At the start of this work, the author emphasizes the dichotomy of the Americas, comparing the industrious North to the less stable and turbulent South. Calderón introduces the themes of colonization, individualism, and political fervor as fundamental to understanding the distinct trajectories of South American nations. He outlines the impact of Spanish tyranny and the subsequent thirst for independence that prompted revolutionary movements across the continent. Describing the richly diverse social fabric resulting from miscegenation, he sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how these historical legacies continue to shape the political ideologies and identities of Latin American nations in their ongoing pursuit of stability and self-determination.
