    "resumo": "\"Essays\" by David Hume is a collection of philosophical essays written in the 18th century. The book covers a range of topics, including politics, taste, and the nature of government, reflecting Hume's explorations of moral and political philosophy. The opening portion introduces Hume's life, detailing his background, education, and the struggles he faced before gaining recognition as a significant thinker of his time.  At the start of the collection, a biographical introduction sets the stage for understanding Hume's perspectives. It discusses his early life, including his ambition toward literature over law, and his move to France, where he began writing significant works, including his \"Treatise of Human Nature.\" Following this, the first essay presents Humeâ€™s thoughts on the \"delicacy of taste and passion,\" exploring how sensitivity to both beauty and adversity shapes human experience, emphasizing that while high sensitivity can lead to greater pleasures and pains, it is preferable to cultivate a refined taste for the arts to balance one's emotional state.
