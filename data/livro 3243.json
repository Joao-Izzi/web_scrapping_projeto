    "resumo": "\"Quin\" by Alice Caldwell Hegan Rice is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story appears to revolve around the lives of two main characters, Sergeant Quinby Graham, a war veteran adjusting to civilian life, and Eleanor Bartlett, a young woman from a prominent but oppressive family. Their interactions seem to center on themes of ambition, love, and the desire for personal freedom amidst societal expectations.  At the start of the novel, we meet Quin, who is recovering from war injuries and exhibits a buoyant spirit despite his struggles. The narrative captures his eagerness to engage with life, culminating in a chance encounter with Eleanor at a dance hall, where their flirtation ignites something deeper. As Quin navigates his feelings for Eleanor, the story hints at the societal constraints she faces, particularly from her family, who seek to control her future and suppress her aspirations. This opening portion sets the stage for a tale filled with emotional complexity and character development, showcasing Quin's determination and Eleanor's yearning for independence.
