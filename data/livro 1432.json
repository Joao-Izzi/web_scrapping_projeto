    "resumo": "\"Crashing Suns\" by Edmond Hamilton is a science fiction novel written in the late 1920s. The story follows Jan Tor, a captain in the Interplanetary Patrol Cruiser, as he embarks on a critical mission to save civilization from the imminent collision of two suns. This adventure thrusts him into perilous situations where he must navigate through both the voids of outer space and fierce battles against alien species who threaten the very existence of humanity.  At the start of the journey, we find Jan Tor piloting his cruiser as he receives orders from the Supreme Council to return to Earth. Accompanied by his engineer, Hal Kur, and fellow officers, Jan reflects on humanity's expansion across the solar system and the dangers posed by an approaching star, Alto, which is on a collision course with the sun. As he races back to Earth, Jan is soon plunged into a crisis when the Supreme Council reveals that the globe-men from Alto have engineered this catastrophic event to escape their dying world. The opening sets the stage for Jan's subsequent questâ€”building a fleet of cruisers to confront this otherworldly threat and save the solar system from annihilation.
