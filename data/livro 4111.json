    "resumo": "\"Anno Domini 2000; or, Woman's Destiny\" by Sir Julius Vogel is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story is set in a future society where women have gained significant power and influence, focusing on the character of Hilda Fitzherbert, a brilliant young woman who rises to a prominent political position. The narrative explores themes of gender roles, social justice, and the political landscape of a changing empire.  The opening of the novel establishes a bleak backdrop through the tragic story of George Claude Sonsius, a man who succumbs to poverty and despair, catalyzing a larger social movement that advocates for the rights of the oppressed. Transitioning into the year 2000, the scene shifts to a flourishing United Britain, where women's rights and statuses have dramatically evolved. Hilda Fitzherbert, now an influential member of the Federal Parliament, grapples with her personal and political duties, encountering figures like Lord Reginald Paramatta who seek her affection but find her commitment to her career paramount. The narrative intertwines personal dilemmas with broader societal shifts, setting the stage for a tale that critically examines the trajectories of power, love, and responsibility.
