    "resumo": "\"Pons Tironum\" by R. B. Appleton and W. H. S. Jones is a Latin textbook aimed at beginner students, likely written in the late 19th century. The book serves as a transitional resource for learners moving from basic to more complex Latin, providing examples of sentences and grammatical constructions to aid in understanding the language's structure.   The opening of \"Pons Tironum\" sets the stage for a playful exploration of daily life through the lens of a young Roman boy, who navigates various commands from family members and servants. The text introduces characters such as the boy's father, his mother, and the servant Davus as they engage in humorous exchanges, emphasizing the need for obedience and the chores associated with daily Roman life. By showcasing the transitions between different scenarios—such as morning routines and tasks to be completed—the excerpt establishes a relatable context that grounds the study of Latin in practical, everyday situations.
