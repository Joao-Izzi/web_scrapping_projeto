    "resumo": "\"Unter Palmen und Buchen. Zweiter Band.\" by Friedrich Gerstäcker is a collection of narratives written in the mid-19th century. The work explores various tales set in tropical regions, likely focusing on the life, culture, and challenges faced by individuals inhabiting such exotic locales. The narratives appear to encompass a blend of adventure and description, hinting at the sociopolitical climates of the time.  The opening of the book presents a detailed exposition on the climate of the tropics, with particular attention to its variations and how these affect the lives of its inhabitants. The text begins by addressing common misconceptions about heat in tropical regions, providing a comparative perspective with Europe. Following this, the narrative transitions into the first story titled \"El Comisario,\" introducing the Caribbean island of Tomaco, its flourishing trade, and the local governance. We learn about the socio-economic dynamics, the impending threat of political upheaval due to the larger conflicts in New Granada, and the characters’ responses to the evolving tensions, painting a vivid picture of life on the island amidst upheaval.
