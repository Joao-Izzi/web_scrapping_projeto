    "resumo": "\"Puhe kunniaseppeleestä\" by Demosthenes is a classical rhetorical treatise written in the early 4th century BC. The work serves as a defense speech by the famed orator Demosthenes against political accusations, particularly in the context of his rivalry with Aiskhines. The opening portion of the text delves into the historical backdrop surrounding the political turmoil in ancient Greece, setting the stage for a narrative filled with themes of patriotism, democracy, and the moral obligations of citizenship.  The beginning of this work introduces Demosthenes as he addresses the Athenian assembly in a courtroom setting, pleading for fairness in listening to his defense against Aiskhines. He acknowledges the emotional weight of the accusations against him, while simultaneously outlining his passion for public service and commitment to his city. The speaker expertly navigates through the complexities of their historical and political environment, laying a foundation for arguments that illustrate not only his own merits but also the dubious character of his opponent. This opening effectively portrays the tension between personal integrity and political machinations of the time, inviting the reader into a rich discourse of rhetoric and civic duty that defines classical Athenian society.
