    "resumo": "\"Powers of the President during Crises\" by J. Malcolm Smith and Cornelius P. Cotter is a political science publication written in the late 20th century. The book explores the complexities surrounding the use of emergency powers by the U.S. president during significant national crises, particularly since 1933. It examines the constitutional framework for such powers and the delicate balance between preserving civil liberties and ensuring national security.  The opening of the book provides a foreword and preface that set the stage for its examination of presidential emergency powers. It begins with a reflection on the historical context and the constitutional basis for emergency powers, drawing parallels to medical prescriptions for powerful drugs like morphine, which can either alleviate suffering or become tools of tyranny if misused. The authors outline their methodology and intent to analyze how emergency powers have been utilized in the U.S. and provide a thorough account of the legal frameworks, oversight mechanisms, and real-life applications of such powers throughout crises, inviting readers to consider the implications for democracy and individual freedoms.
