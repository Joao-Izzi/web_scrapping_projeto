    "resumo": "\"La Comédie humaine - Volume 10. Scènes de la vie parisienne - Tome 02\" by Honoré de Balzac is a novel written in the mid-19th century. This volume includes several tales, with a primary focus on the character Colonel Chabert and his struggles following his return from presumed death after a battle. The narrative delves into themes of identity, societal struggles, and the irony of a soldier's fate in a world that has moved on without him.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to a busy office where clerks engage in playful banter and conduct legal business typical of Parisian life. Colonel Chabert, having survived being declared dead in battle, attempts to reclaim his former life and fortune that have been unjustly usurped by his wife, now married to another man. The opening portrays his desperate situation—as he faces disbelief and mockery from the clerks when trying to assert his identity. His encounter with the young lawyer Derville marks the beginning of a complex legal battle that involves themes of status, recognition, and the human condition.
