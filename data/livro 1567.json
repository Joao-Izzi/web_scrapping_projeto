    "resumo": "\"The Vast Abyss\" by George Manville Fenn is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story follows a young boy named Tom Blount, who is struggling to find his place in the world after losing both parents to an epidemic. Displaced by circumstance, Tom finds himself in a challenging environment with his unappreciative uncle and a bullying cousin, Sam. As he grapples with his new life and the challenges of legal studies, Tom is offered a glimmer of hope when another uncle invites him to join him in a more fulfilling and adventurous endeavor.  At the start of the book, we are introduced to Tom Blount in a dreary office where he feels out of place and incompetent under the harsh criticism of his uncle, James Brandon. Tom's thoughts frequently drift towards memories of happier times with his parents and the boyhood adventures he yearns to reclaim. With the help of a kind clerk named Pringle, Tom endures day-to-day challenges, including the persistent torment from his cousin Sam. The opening chapters set up a vivid portrayal of Tom's struggles, emotions, and determination to prove himself worthy of his family's support, culminating in a transformative invitation from his Uncle Richard to leave his current hardships behind and seek a new life filled with opportunities.
