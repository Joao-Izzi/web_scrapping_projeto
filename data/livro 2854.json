    "resumo": "\"A King of Tyre: A Tale of the Times of Ezra and Nehemiah\" by James M. Ludlow is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. Set in the mid-5th century B.C., the story takes place in the city of Tyre and revolves around King Hiram, who grapples with the conflict between his authority and the powerful priesthood that seeks to manipulate public sentiment for sacrificial rites to appease their god, Baal. The narrative explores themes of political power, religion, and personal sacrifice amidst a backdrop of societal tensions and the encroaching influence of Greek culture.  The beginning of the novel introduces readers to the vibrant, bustling city of Tyre, highlighting its significance as a commercial hub and the desperate mood of its inhabitants in light of a religious proclamation for a grand celebration involving sacrifices. King Hiram, newly crowned and critical of the priests' traditions, finds himself at odds with both the priestly class and his cousin Rubaal. As the council proposes extreme acts of devotion to restore Phoenician prestige, Hiram's open dissent against these practices sets the stage for a brewing conflict that threatens his reign. The charactersâ€™ complexities are revealed, foreshadowing the intertwining fates of Hiram, the ambitious merchant Ahimelek, and the opposition posed by the priesthood, encapsulating a struggle for identity and power within the ancient world.
