    "resumo": "\"Mr. and Mrs. Sên\" by Louise Jordan Miln is a novel written in the early 20th century. The story primarily revolves around Miss Julia Townsend, a proud Southern woman holding onto her family's aristocratic traditions in Virginia, navigating her social life in a changing America. As the narrative unfolds, themes of race, class, and individual identity begin to emerge, especially through Julia's interactions with people from diverse backgrounds.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Julia Townsend, the last surviving member of the esteemed Townsend family, living in Rosehill, her family home steeped in tradition and remnants of a proud past. Through vivid descriptions, we learn about her unique character attributes—she is both gracious yet exclusive, proud yet charitable, embodying the complexities of Southern genteel society. The narrative details Julia's interactions, particularly focusing on her friendship with Sên King-lo, a Chinese gentleman who has been welcomed into her circle. Ivy Gilbert, a nursery governess who stays with Julia, provides another perspective that juxtaposes her own views on race and class against Julia's established traditions, highlighting the evolving dynamics in society. These interactions set the stage for deeper explorations of cultural identity and the challenges of social acceptance. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
