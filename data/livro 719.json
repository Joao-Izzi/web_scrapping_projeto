    "resumo": "\"A Book of Ghosts\" by S. Baring-Gould is a collection of ghost stories written in the early 20th century. The book features a series of narratives that explore the eerie encounters and the supernatural, alongside cultural and historical elements, primarily set in England and France. The tales promise to take readers on a spine-tingling exploration of spectral encounters, showcasing an array of characters and their haunted experiences.  The opening portion of the book introduces the narrator's visit to Orléans, where he seeks to gather material for a biography of Joan of Arc. Disappointed by the modernity of the town and its lack of authentic historical relics, the narrator's experiences come alive when he encounters a mysterious waiter named Jean Bouchon who persistently seeks payment for the coffee he serves. As the narrator learns more about Bouchon's past—his dismissal for stealing tips and subsequent death—he discovers that Bouchon has haunted the café since 1869, only bothering visitors. This odd narrative sets the stage for a mix of curiosity, humor, and the supernatural, hinting at the unique stories that will follow in the collection.
