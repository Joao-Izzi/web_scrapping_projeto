    "resumo": "\"The Real Gladstone: An Anecdotal Biography\" by J. Ewing Ritchie is a biographical account written in the late 19th century. This book offers a glimpse into the life of William Ewart Gladstone, Englandâ€™s renowned statesman, through a collection of anecdotes and personal reflections. Rather than presenting an exhaustive narrative, it serves to illuminate the character and public service of Gladstone in a style that appeals to both the general public and those intrigued by his legacy.  The opening of the biography introduces readers to Gladstone's early life, beginning with his birth in Liverpool in 1809. Ritchie recounts formative experiences, such as his schooling at Seaforth, which set the stage for his illustrious career. The text describes his family environment, filled with vigorous debates that shaped his character, and his keen engagement with educational pursuits at Eton and later at Oxford University. Through the lens of these early years, Ritchie establishes the foundations of Gladstone's convictions and ambitions that would later define him as a prominent political figure.
