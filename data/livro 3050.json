    "resumo": "\"What She Could\" by Susan Warner is a novel written in the late 19th century. The story unfolds in a comfortable and respectable household, focusing on the lives of several young girls and their interactions within the community, particularly concerning their religious commitments and friendships. Central to the narrative are sisters Maria and Matilda, who grapple with the expectations of growing up, the desire to be good, and the significance of their roles within their church community.  The opening of the book introduces us to the Englefield family, highlighting the children's lives and their connection to the Sunday School. After attending a meeting led by Mr. Richmond, the girls discuss their eagerness to form a group dubbed the \"Sunday-School Working Band,\" with Maria enthusiastically sharing her experiences while Matilda is depicted as more contemplative and uncertain. As the sisters engage in playful banter about their responsibilities and aspirations, the narrative sets the stage for deeper explorations of faith, duty, and personal growth, especially through Matilda's evolving relationship with Mr. Richmond, who encourages her to confront her apprehensions about service and faith head-on.
