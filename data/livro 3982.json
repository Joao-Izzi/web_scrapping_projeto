    "resumo": "\"A Parody Outline of History\" by Donald Ogden Stewart is a satirical collection that humorously explores American historical events through the lens of famous contemporary authors. Written in the early 20th century, it presents a playful and irreverent take on significant events in American history, using the stylistic quirks of various notable writers to recount these tales in a lighthearted manner.  The opening of this work introduces the idea that American history can best be told by Americans, playfully critiquing H.G. Wells' omission of certain events in his own historical outline. Stewart embarks on this endeavor with a set of short chapters that will parody the styles of writers ranging from William Lyon Phelps to Sinclair Lewis, and more. The first chapter functions as a commentary on American history itself, reminiscing about a performance of \"Peter Pan\" and weaving in humorous anecdotals about figures like Woodrow Wilson. This preamble sets the stage for the unique format of the book, as it seems ready to blend historical fiction with comedic parodies that challenge the traditional narratives of American history.
