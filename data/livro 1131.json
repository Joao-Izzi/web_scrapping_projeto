    "resumo": "\"Writing Class\" by Robert Sheckley is a satirical science fiction short story written in the early 1950s. The narrative centers around a writing class led by Professor Carner, a seasoned writer of alien encounters and speculative fiction, as he instructs students on the finer points of avoiding clich√©s in their descriptions of extraterrestrial life. The tale explores themes of creativity, originality, and the sometimes stifling nature of imposed writing conventions.  The story follows Eddie McDermott, a student who is initially unenthusiastic about the class. As Professor Carner emphasizes the importance of fresh perspectives and deeper character development, Eddie grows increasingly frustrated with the constraints placed on creative writing. He believes in the power of dramatic flair, preferring the vivid, straightforward depictions of aliens that his professor discourages. Ultimately, Eddie decides to drop the course, choosing to pursue his passion for writing fiction rather than adhere to the rigid rules of journalism, which he finds uninspiring. The narrative thus serves not only as a comedic take on the writing process but also as a commentary on the balance between originality and convention in storytelling.
