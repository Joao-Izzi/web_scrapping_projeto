    "resumo": "\"The Moth and the Flame\" by Clyde Fitch is a play written in the late 19th century. The work delves into the complexities of love and social dynamics, focusing on the tension between personal desires and societal expectations. The story unfolds at a fancy ball hosted by the Wolton family, where characters navigate their feelings amid the pressures of wealth, reputation, and morality.  The opening of the play features a vibrant scene set at the Wolton home during a children's-themed fancy ball. Guests are seen engaging in light-hearted games and conversations, with the atmosphere filled with laughter and excitement. Central to the plot are Marion Wolton and Douglas Rhodes, whose interactions highlight the underlying tension of unvoiced emotions and romantic aspirations, particularly as Marion grapples with her feelings for the charming but morally ambiguous Edward Fletcher.
