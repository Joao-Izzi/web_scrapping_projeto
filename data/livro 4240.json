    "resumo": "\"The Minister's Wife\" by Mrs. Oliphant is a novel written in the late 19th century. The narrative unfolds in a rural Scottish setting, exploring themes of family loyalty, social dynamics, and the clash between personal desires and community expectations. The story primarily revolves around sisters Margaret and Isabel Diarmid, who navigate the complexities of their intertwined lives after the death of their father, while also dealing with their stepmother and their relationships within a religiously charged community.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the Diarmid family living in the Glebe Cottage by Loch Diarmid. The opening chapters reveal the contrasting personalities of sisters Margaret and Isabel, delving into their family history and the legacy of their father. As the narrative unfolds, we see the challenges they face, particularly focusing on Margaret's declining health and Isabel's earthly concerns, including a budding romance with a young Englishman named Horace Stapylton. The community is caught up in a wave of miraculous healings, which adds to the tension, especially as Margaret struggles against societal and family pressures while maintaining her quiet dignity. This initial segment sets the stage for their emotional conflicts and the unfolding drama that will challenge their bonds and beliefs in profound ways. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",
