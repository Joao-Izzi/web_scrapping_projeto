    "resumo": "\"Constitutional History of England, Henry VII to George II. Volume 1 of 3\" by Henry Hallam is a historical account written in the early 19th century. This work examines the evolution of the English constitution and government from the late 15th century through the early 18th century, focusing on the complexities of political authority and personal liberties over these centuries. Hallam's aim is to offer insights into the development of legal frameworks and the relationship between the monarchy and the subjects during this transformative period.  The opening of the volume introduces the historical backdrop of the English constitution at the onset of Henry VII's reign. It outlines the mixed monarchy of England, emphasizing the limitations placed on the royal authority by law and the role of Parliament in mediating the power of the king. Hallam discusses key principles such as the necessity for parliamentary consent for taxation and legislation, the right to trial by jury, and protections against arbitrary imprisonment. The narrative sets the stage for a detailed exploration of how these constitutional safeguards evolved amid royal ambitions and socio-political upheavals, critiquing the precarious balance between authority and liberty in the early modern state.
