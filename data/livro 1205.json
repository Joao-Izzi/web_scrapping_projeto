    "resumo": "\"The Three Comrades\" by Kristína Royová is a novel written in the early 20th century. It tells the story of three orphans, Petrik, Ondrejko, and Fido the dog, who form a close bond while living under the care of Bacha Filina in the Slovak mountains. The narrative explores themes of friendship, familial love, and the hardships of orphanhood, as the boys navigate their lives amid a landscape filled with nature's beauty and human struggles.  At the start of the story, we meet Petrik and Ondrejko, both neglected orphans with challenging pasts who find solace in their companionship and the presence of their animal friend, Fido. The chapter introduces their caretaker, Bacha Filina, who, despite his stern demeanor, shows kindness and wisdom as he guides the boys. In this setting, the boys grapple with their identities and the memories of their lost families. As they go through daily routines, such as attending church, meeting new acquaintances, and engaging in conversations with Filina about life lessons and morality, they create an idyllic, albeit hard-earned, existence. The opening portion sets a foundation for the boys' adventures and lays the groundwork for deeper explorations into their relationships and emotional journeys as the story unfolds.
