    "resumo": "\"The Fourth Battalion, The King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) and the Great War\" by Lieut.-Colonel W. F. A. Wadham and Captain J. Crossley is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book documents the experiences and operations of the Fourth Battalion during World War I, particularly focusing on the mobilization, training, and various battles faced by the regiment. It captures both the personal experiences of the soldiers and the administrative details that led to their deployment and actions in the war.  The opening of the narrative sets the stage for the battalion's journey at the onset of World War I, starting with their preparation and mobilization in 1914. It details their initial assembly for training, the gradual escalation towards active service, and the logistical struggles faced as they transitioned from a peace time unit to a combat-ready battalion. The soldiers' early days are marked by a sense of impending duty and the uncertainty that looms as they receive their mobilization orders, ultimately leading to their first experiences as soldiers tasked with defending key locations within the UK before heading overseas. This introductory portion effectively lays the foundation for the larger historical context and the individual stories that will unfold throughout the rest of the book.
