    "resumo": "\"The Last Entry\" by William Clark Russell is a novel written in the late 19th century. Set against the backdrop of maritime adventures in 1837, the story introduces Mr. Montagu Vanderholt, a wealthy retired merchant, and his daughter Violet, who embark on a cruise aboard the schooner \"Mowbray\" for the sake of his health. This journey promises to be filled with thrilling sea life and personal discoveries, as well as the challenges and dangers that come with the open water.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to the Vanderholts during breakfast, where Mr. Vanderholt shares his plans for a voyage to the Equator, intending to escape the cold winter in England. Violet expresses concern over a potential early arrival of her fiancé, Captain George Parry, who is away in India. Their conversation reveals both Mr. Vanderholt's strong personality and his affection for his daughter, as well as her own feelings about the journey and her fiancé. Following their departure from London, the vibrant scenes of the Thames and the ship's preparations set the stage for their oceanic adventure, hinting at the interplay of romance and danger that will unfold as they sail into the unknown.
