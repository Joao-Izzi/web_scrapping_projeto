    "resumo": "\"Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography\" by Andy Adams is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book details the life of Reed Anthony, an experienced cattleman, reflecting on his experiences in the cattle industry, from his childhood in Virginia to his adventures in Texas during a transformative era for the American West.  The opening of the book introduces Reed Anthony as a man whose life has been distinctly intertwined with cattle, beginning with his upbringing in the Shenandoah Valley and his service in the Confederate army. As he narrates his boyhood experiences driving cattle to market and his subsequent longing for a life in the West, readers gain insight into the challenges and dreams of a pioneer in the rapidly changing landscape of 19th-century America. Anthony recounts vivid memories of family and farming, mingled with the harsh realities of war, and sets the stage for his journey across the frontier, where he realizes his aspirations amidst the ruggedness of cowboy life.
