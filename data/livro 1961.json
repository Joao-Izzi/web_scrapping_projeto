    "resumo": "\"Agnes of Sorrento\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story is set in the idyllic coastal town of Sorrento, Italy, during a period that evokes themes of spirituality and personal struggle, particularly as they relate to the life of the main character, Agnes. The narrative intertwines the historical context of the Church's influence with the life of Agnes, a young girl raised by her grandmother, Elsie, who hopes to shield her from worldly temptations while preparing her for a virtuous future.  The opening of the novel introduces readers to the tranquil beauty of Sorrento and the innocent life of Agnes, who is about fifteen and deeply spiritual. Under the arched gateway of Sorrento, she is depicted as being admired by a handsome cavalier, which brings out her grandmotherâ€™s protective instincts. As Agnes navigates these early encounters with the opposite sex, she remains focused on her faith and the noble example of Saint Agnes, whom she is named after. The narrative sets a foundation for Agnes's struggles with her own desires, family expectations, and the overarching themes of faith and personal strength that will unfold throughout the story.
