    "resumo": "\"Six Modern Women: Psychological Sketches\" by Laura Marholm is a collection of biographical sketches written in the late 19th century. The work explores the lives and experiences of six influential women, focusing on their emotional struggles and the inherent conflicts between their intellect and womanly instincts. Notable figures include Sonia Kovalevsky, Marie Bashkirtseff, and Eleonora Duse, among others, highlighting their journeys through societal expectations and personal aspirations.  The opening of the work establishes Marholm's intent to delve into the emotional lives of these modern women rather than just their accomplishments. She reflects on how their successes often came at the expense of their inner fulfillment, emphasizing the tension between societal roles and individual desires. The text introduces Sonia Kovalevsky's life and reveals her profound loneliness and dissatisfaction despite her intellectual achievements, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of the psychological struggles faced by women in her time. Throughout the introduction, Marholm's analysis suggests a combination of admiration and pity for these pioneering women as they navigate a world that frequently undermines their true selves.
