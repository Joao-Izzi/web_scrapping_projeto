    "resumo": "\"The Best Short Stories of 1919 and the Yearbook of the American Short Story,\" edited by Edward J. O'Brien, is a collection of short stories published during the year, encapsulating the literary trends and themes of early 20th-century American fiction. This anthology comprises various notable authors of the time, showcasing a diverse range of characters and narratives that highlight the human experience from multiple viewpoints. The collection reflects the evolving American narrative style and offers insight into the social fabric of the decade.  The opening of the anthology introduces the reader to the editor’s insightful preface, where O’Brien reflects on the state of American literature and critiques its tendencies towards optimism in the face of harsh realities. This is followed by the first story, \"The Kitchen Gods\" by Gulielma Fell Alsop, which transports us to a Chinese household where the small wife, Dong-Yung, navigates the complexities of her place between tradition and a yearning for personal autonomy, while her husband, Foh-Kyung, explores new spiritual beliefs. This poignant exploration of cultural contrasts and personal conflict sets the stage for the themes of identity and societal roles that are likely to be recurrent throughout the collection.
