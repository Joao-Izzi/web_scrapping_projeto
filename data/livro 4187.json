    "resumo": "\"Early British Trackways, Moats, Mounds, Camps, and Sites\" by Alfred Watkins is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book meticulously investigates the ancient trackways and associated structures in Britain, delving into their design and function from prehistoric times through the Roman occupation. Watkins proposes a systematic approach to understanding how these features were interconnected and the implications of their layouts for early human activity and navigation.  At the start of the work, the author reflects on the prevailing misconceptions surrounding the study of ancient trackways, highlighting the need for new evidence and methods to uncover their true nature. He outlines how his exploration of maps and field observations led to the discovery of sighting lines linking various structures, such as mounds, moats, and churches. Watkins calls upon readers to engage in their own investigations, providing a rationale grounded in physical evidence and urging a collaborative effort to re-evaluate previous conclusions held by antiquarians. This opening portion sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how these ancient routes and landmarks are aligned in ways that reveal a sophisticated planning system employed by early Britons.
